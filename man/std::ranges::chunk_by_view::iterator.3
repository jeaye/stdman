.SH NAME
std::ranges::chunk_by_view::iterator \- std::ranges::chunk_by_view::iterator

.SH Synopsis
   class /*iterator*/  (since C++23)
                       (exposition only*)

   The return type of chunk_by_view::begin, and of chunk_by_view::end when the
   underlying view V is a common_range.

.SH Member types

   Member type       Definition
   value_type        ranges::subrange<ranges::iterator_t<V>>
   difference_type   ranges::range_difference_t<V>
   iterator_category std::input_iterator_tag
                       * std::bidirectional_iterator_tag, if V models
   iterator_concept      bidirectional_range, otherwise
                       * std::forward_iterator_tag.

   Data members

   Member object      Definition
   parent_ (private)  A pointer to the parent chunk_by_view.
                      (exposition-only member object*)
   current_ (private) ranges::iterator_t<V>, an iterator to the begin of current chunk.
                      (exposition-only member object*)
                      ranges::iterator_t<V>, an iterator to the begin of next chunk, if
   next_ (private)    present.
                      (exposition-only member object*)
