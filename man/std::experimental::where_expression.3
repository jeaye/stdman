.SH NAME
std::experimental::where_expression \- std::experimental::where_expression

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/simd>
   template < class M, class V >          (parallelism TS v2)
   class where_expression;

   The class template where_expression abstracts the notion of selected elements of a
   given non-const object of arithmetic or data-parallel type. Selected elements
   signifies the elements data[i] for all i ∈ {j ∈ ℕ0 | j < M::size() ⋀
   mask[j]}.

.SH Template parameters

   M - The mask type
   V - The value type M applies on

   Valid combinations of (M, V) are: (simd_mask<T, Abi>, simd<T, Abi>), (simd_mask<T,
   Abi>, simd_mask<T, Abi>), (bool, T).
