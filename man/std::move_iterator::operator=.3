.SH Synopsis
   template< class U >                                                   \fI(until C++17)\fP
   move_iterator& operator=( const move_iterator<U>& other );
   template< class U >                                                   \fI(since C++17)\fP
   constexpr move_iterator& operator=( const move_iterator<U>& other );

   The underlying iterator is assigned the value of the underlying iterator of other,
   i.e. other.base().

   The behavior is undefined if U is not convertible to Iter.             \fI(until C++20)\fP
   This overload participates in overload resolution only if U is not the
   same type as Iter and std::convertible_to<const U&, Iter> and          \fI(since C++20)\fP
   std::assignable_from<Iter&, const U&> are modeled.

.SH Parameters
