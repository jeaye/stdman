   destructor   destroys the exception object
   \fB[virtual]\fP    \fI(virtual public member function of std::exception)\fP

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <regex>
 #include <iostream>
  
 int main()
 {
     try {
         std::regex re("[a-b][a");
     }
  
     catch (const std::regex_error& e) {
         std::cout << "regex_error caught: " << e.what() << '\\n';
         if (e.code() == std::regex_constants::error_brack) {
             std::cout << "The code was error_brack\\n";
         }
     }
 }

.SH Output:

 regex_error caught: The expression contained mismatched [ and ].
 The code was error_brack
