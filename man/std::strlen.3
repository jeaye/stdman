.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstring>
   std::size_t strlen( const char* str );

   Returns the length of the given byte string, that is, the number of characters in a
   character array whose first element is pointed to by str up to and not including the
   first null character. The behavior is undefined if there is no null character in the
   character array pointed to by str.

.SH Parameters

   str - pointer to the null-terminated byte string to be examined

.SH Return value

   The length of the null-terminated string str.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <cstring>
 #include <iostream>
  
 int main()
 {
    const char str[] = "How many characters does this string contain?";
  
    std::cout << "without null character: " << std::strlen(str) << '\\n'
              << "with null character: " << sizeof str << '\\n';
 }
