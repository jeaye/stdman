.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <mdspan>
   struct layout_right;        (since C++23)

   layout_right is a LayoutMappingPolicy and trivial type which provides a layout
   mapping where the rightmost extent has stride 1, and strides increase right-to-left
   as the product of extents.

   It is the default layout mapping policy used by std::mdspan if no user-specified
   layout is provided.
