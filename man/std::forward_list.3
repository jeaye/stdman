   std::forward_list is a container that supports fast insertion and removal of
   elements from anywhere in the container. Fast random access is not supported. It is
   implemented as a singly-linked list. Compared to std::list this container provides
   more space efficient storage when bidirectional iteration is not needed.

   Adding, removing and moving the elements within the list, or across several lists,
   does not invalidate the iterators currently referring to other elements in the list.
   However, an iterator or reference referring to an element is invalidated when the
   corresponding element is removed (via erase_after) from the list.

   std::forward_list meets the requirements of Container (except for the size member
   function and that operator=='s complexity is always linear), AllocatorAwareContainer
   and SequenceContainer.

.SH Template parameters

               The type of the elements.

               The requirements that are imposed on the elements depend on the
               actual operations performed on the container. Generally, it is    (until
               required that element type is a complete type and meets the       C++17)
               requirements of Erasable, but many member functions impose
               stricter requirements.
   T         - The requirements that are imposed on the elements depend on the
               actual operations performed on the container. Generally, it is
               required that element type meets the requirements of Erasable,
               but many member functions impose stricter requirements. This      (since
               container (but not its members) can be instantiated with an       C++17)
               incomplete element type if the allocator satisfies the allocator
               completeness requirements.

               Feature-test macro: __cpp_lib_incomplete_container_elements
               An allocator that is used to acquire/release memory and to
               construct/destroy the elements in that memory. The type must meet the
               requirements of Allocator.
   Allocator - The behavior is undefined

               The program is ill-formed
               \fI(since C++20)\fP if Allocator::value_type is not the same as T.
