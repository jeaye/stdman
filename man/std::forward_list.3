   std::forward_list is a container that supports fast insertion and removal of
   elements from anywhere in the container. Fast random access is not supported. It is
   implemented as a singly-linked list and essentially does not have any overhead
   compared to its implementation in C. Compared to std::list this container provides
   more space efficient storage when bidirectional iteration is not needed.

   Adding, removing and moving the elements within the list, or across several lists,
   does not invalidate the iterators currently referring to other elements in the list.
   However, an iterator or reference referring to an element is invalidated when the
   corresponding element is removed (via erase_after) from the list.

   std::forward_list meets the requirements of Container (except for the size member
   function and that operator=='s complexity is always linear), AllocatorAwareContainer
   and SequenceContainer.

.SH Template parameters

               The type of the elements.

               The requirements that are imposed on the elements depend
               on the actual operations performed on the container.
               Generally, it is required that element type is a complete  \fI(until C++17)\fP
               type and meets the requirements of Erasable, but many
               member functions impose stricter requirements.
               The requirements that are imposed on the elements depend
   T         - on the actual operations performed on the container.
               Generally, it is required that element type meets the
               requirements of Erasable, but many member functions impose \fI(since C++17)\fP
               stricter requirements. This container (but not its
               members) can be instantiated with an incomplete element
               type if the allocator satisfies the allocator completeness
               requirements.

               
               An allocator that is used to acquire/release memory and to
   Allocator - construct/destroy the elements in that memory. The type must meet the
               requirements of Allocator. The behavior is undefined if
               Allocator::value_type is not the same as T.
