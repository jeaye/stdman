.SH NAME
std::multimap::emplace_hint \- std::multimap::emplace_hint

.SH Synopsis
   template <class... Args>                                       \fI(since C++11)\fP
   iterator emplace_hint( const_iterator hint, Args&&... args );

   Inserts a new element into the container as close as possible to the position just
   before hint. The element is constructed in-place, i.e. no copy or move operations
   are performed.

   The constructor of the element type (value_type, that is, std::pair<const Key, T>)
   is called with exactly the same arguments as supplied to the function, forwarded
   with std::forward<Args>(args)....

   No iterators or references are invalidated.

.SH Parameters

   hint - iterator to the position before which the new element will be inserted
   args - arguments to forward to the constructor of the element

.SH Return value

   Returns an iterator to the newly inserted element.

.SH Exceptions

   If an exception is thrown by any operation, this function has no effect (strong
   exception guarantee).

.SH Complexity

   Logarithmic in the size of the container in general, but amortized constant if the
   new element is inserted just before hint.
