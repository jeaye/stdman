.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <compare>
   inline namespace /* unspecified */ {

       inline constexpr /* unspecified */ weak_order = /* unspecified     \fI(since C++20)\fP
   */;

   }
   Call signature
   template< class T, class U >

       requires /* see below */

   constexpr std::weak_ordering weak_order(T&& t, U&& u) noexcept(/* see
   below */);

   Compares two values using 3-way comparison and produces a result of type
   std::weak_ordering

   Let t and u be expressions and T and U denote decltype((t)) and decltype((u))
   respectively, std::weak_order(t, u) is expression-equivalent to:

     * If std::is_same_v<std::decay_t<T>, std::decay_t<U>> == true:

          * std::weak_ordering(weak_order(t, u)), if it is a well-formed expression
            with overload resolution performed in a context that does not include a
            declaration of std::weak_order,
          * otherwise, if T is a floating-point type:

               * if std::numeric_limits<T>::is_iec559 is true, performs the weak
                 ordering comparison of floating-point values (see below) and returns
                 that result as a value of type std::weak_ordering,
               * otherwise, yields a value of type std::weak_ordering that is
                 consistent with the ordering observed by T's comparison operators,

          * otherwise std::weak_ordering(std::compare_three_way()(t, u), if it is
            well-formed,
          * otherwise std::weak_ordering(std::strong_order(t, u)), if it is
            well-formed,
          * other the expression is ill-formed, which can result in substitution
            failure when it appears in the immediate context of a template
            instantiation.

     * Otherwise, std::weak_order(t, u) is ill-formed.

.SH Notes

     Strict weak order of IEEE floating-point types

   Let x and y be values of same IEEE floating-point type, and weak_order_less(x, y) be
   the boolean result indicating if x precedes y in the strict weak order defined by
   the C++ standard.

     * If neither x nor y is NaN, then weak_order_less(x, y) == true if and only if x <
       y, i.e. all representations of equal floating-point value are equivalent;
     * If x is negative NaN and y is not negative NaN, then weak_order_less(x, y) ==
       true;
     * If x is not positive NaN and y is positive NaN, then weak_order_less(x, y) ==
       true;
     * If both x and y are NaNs with the same sign, then weak_order_less(x, y) ||
       weak_order_less(y, x) == false, i.e. all NaNs with the same sign are equivalent.
