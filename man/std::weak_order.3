.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <compare>
   inline namespace /* unspecified */ {

   inline constexpr /* unspecified */ weak_order = /* unspecified */;     \fI(since C++20)\fP

   }
   Call signature
   template< class T, class U >

   requires /* see below */

   constexpr std::weak_ordering weak_order(T&& t, U&& u) noexcept(/* see
   below */);

   Compares two values using 3-way comparison and produces a result of type
   std::weak_ordering

   Let t and u be expressions and T and U denote decltype((t)) and decltype((u))
   respectively, std::weak_order(t, u) is expression-equivalent to:

     * If std::is_same_v<std::decay_t<T>, std::decay_t<U>> is true:

          * std::weak_ordering(weak_order(t, u)), if it is a well-formed expression
            with overload resolution performed in a context that does not include a
            declaration of std::weak_order,
          * otherwise, if T is a floating-point type:

               * if std::numeric_limits<T>::is_iec559 is true, performs the weak
                 ordering comparison of floating-point values (see below) and returns
                 that result as a value of type std::weak_ordering,
               * otherwise, yields a value of type std::weak_ordering that is
                 consistent with the ordering observed by T's comparison operators,

          * otherwise, std::weak_ordering(std::compare_three_way()(t, u)), if it is
            well-formed,
          * otherwise, std::weak_ordering(std::strong_order(t, u)), if it is
            well-formed.

     * In all other cases, the expression is ill-formed, which can result in
       substitution failure when it appears in the immediate context of a template
       instantiation.

  Expression-equivalent

   Expression e is expression-equivalent to expression f, if e and f have the same
   effects, either are both potentially-throwing or are both not potentially-throwing
   (i.e. noexcept(e) == noexcept(f)), and either are both constant subexpressions or
   are both not constant subexpressions.

  Customization point objects

   The name std::weak_order denotes a customization point object, which is a const
   function object of a literal semiregular class type. For exposition purposes, the
   cv-unqualified version of its type is denoted as __weak_order_fn.

   All instances of __weak_order_fn are equal. The effects of invoking different
   instances of type __weak_order_fn on the same arguments are equivalent, regardless
   of whether the expression denoting the instance is an lvalue or rvalue, and is
   const-qualified or not (however, a volatile-qualified instance is not required to be
   invocable). Thus, std::weak_order can be copied freely and its copies can be used
   interchangeably.

   Given a set of types Args..., if std::declval<Args>()... meet the requirements for
   arguments to std::weak_order above, __weak_order_fn models
   std::invocable<__weak_order_fn, Args...>, std::invocable<const __weak_order_fn,
   Args...>, std::invocable<__weak_order_fn&, Args...>, and std::invocable<const
   __weak_order_fn&, Args...>. Otherwise, no function call operator of __weak_order_fn
   participates in overload resolution.

.SH Notes

    Strict weak order of IEEE floating-point types

   Let x and y be values of same IEEE floating-point type, and weak_order_less(x, y) be
   the boolean result indicating if x precedes y in the strict weak order defined by
   the C++ standard.

     * If neither x nor y is NaN, then weak_order_less(x, y) == true if and only if x <
       y, i.e. all representations of equal floating-point value are equivalent;
     * If x is negative NaN and y is not negative NaN, then weak_order_less(x, y) ==
       true;
     * If x is not positive NaN and y is positive NaN, then weak_order_less(x, y) ==
       true;
     * If both x and y are NaNs with the same sign, then weak_order_less(x, y) ||
       weak_order_less(y, x) == false, i.e. all NaNs with the same sign are equivalent.
