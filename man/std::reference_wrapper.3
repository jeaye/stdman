.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <functional>
   template< class T >             \fI(since C++11)\fP
   class reference_wrapper;

   std::reference_wrapper is a class template that wraps a reference in a copyable,
   assignable object. It is frequently used as a mechanism to store references inside
   standard containers (like std::vector) which cannot normally hold references.

   Specifically, std::reference_wrapper is a CopyConstructible and CopyAssignable
   wrapper around a reference to object or reference to function of type T. Instances
   of std::reference_wrapper are objects (they can be copied or stored in containers)
   but they are implicitly convertible to T&, so that they can be used as arguments
   with the functions that take the underlying type by reference.

   Helper functions std::ref and std::cref are often used to generate
   std::reference_wrapper objects.

   std::reference_wrapper is also used to pass objects to std::bind or to the
   constructor of std::thread by reference.

   std::reference_wrapper is guaranteed to be TriviallyCopyable. (since C++17)

.SH Member types

   type                 definition
   type                 T
   result_type          The return type of T if T is a function. Otherwise, not defined
                        1) if T is a function or pointer to function that takes one
                        argument of type A1, then argument_type is A1.

   argument_type        2) if T is a pointer to member function of class T0 that takes
                        no arguments, then argument_type is T0*, possibly cv-qualified
                        3) if T is a class type with a member type T::argument_type,
                        then argument_type is an alias of that
                        1) if T is a function or pointer to function that takes two
                        arguments of type s A1 and A2, then first_argument_type is A1.

                        2) if T is a pointer to member function of class T0 that takes
   first_argument_type  one argument, then first_argument_type is T0*, possibly
                        cv-qualified
                        3) if T is a class type with a member type
                        T::first_argument_type, then first_argument_type is an alias of
                        that
                        1) if T is a function or pointer to function that takes two
                        arguments of type s A1 and A2, then second_argument_type is A2.

                        2) if T is a pointer to member function of class T0 that takes
   second_argument_type one argument A1, then second_argument_type is A1, possibly
                        cv-qualified
                        3) if T is a class type with a member type
                        T::second_argument_type, then second_argument_type is an alias
                        of that

.SH Example

   Demonstrates the use of reference_wrapper as a container of references, which makes
   it possible to access the same container using multiple indexes

   
// Run this code

 #include <algorithm>
 #include <list>
 #include <vector>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <numeric>
 #include <random>
 #include <functional>

 int main()
 {
     std::list<int> l(10);
     std::iota(l.begin(), l.end(), -4);

     std::vector<std::reference_wrapper<int>> v(l.begin(), l.end());
     // can't use shuffle on a list (requires random access), but can use it on a vector
     std::shuffle(v.begin(), v.end(), std::mt19937{std::random_device{}()});

     std::cout << "Contents of the list: ";
     for (int n : l) std::cout << n << ' '; std::cout << '\\n';

     std::cout << "Contents of the list, as seen through a shuffled vector: ";
     for (int i : v) std::cout << i << ' '; std::cout << '\\n';

     std::cout << "Doubling the values in the initial list...\\n";
     for (int& i : l) {
         i *= 2;
     }

     std::cout << "Contents of the list, as seen through a shuffled vector: ";
     for (int i : v) std::cout << i << ' '; std::cout << '\\n';
 }

.SH Possible output:

 Contents of the list: -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5
 Contents of the list, as seen through a shuffled vector: -1 2 -2 1 5 0 3 -3 -4 4
 Doubling the values in the initial list...
 Contents of the list, as seen through a shuffled vector: -2 4 -4 2 10 0 6 -6 -8 8
