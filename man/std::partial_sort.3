std::partial_sort \- std::partial_sort

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <algorithm>
   template< class RandomIt >
   void partial_sort( RandomIt first, RandomIt middle, RandomIt last  \fB(1)\fP
   );
   template< class ExecutionPolicy, class RandomIt >
   void partial_sort( ExecutionPolicy&& policy, RandomIt first,       \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   RandomIt middle, RandomIt last );
   template< class RandomIt, class Compare >
   void partial_sort( RandomIt first, RandomIt middle, RandomIt last, \fB(3)\fP
   Compare comp );
   template< class ExecutionPolicy, class RandomIt, class Compare >
   void partial_sort( ExecutionPolicy&& policy, RandomIt first,       \fB(4)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   RandomIt middle, RandomIt last, Compare comp );

   Rearranges elements such that the range [first, middle) contains the sorted middle -
   first smallest elements in the range [first, last).

   The order of equal elements is not guaranteed to be preserved. The order of the
   remaining elements in the range [middle, last) is unspecified.

   1) Elements are compared using operator<.
   3) Elements are compared using the given binary comparison function comp.
   2,4) Same as (1,3), but executed according to policy. These overloads do not
   participate in overload resolution unless
   std::is_execution_policy_v<std::decay_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true

.SH Parameters

   first, last - the range of elements to sort
   policy      - the execution policy to use. See execution policy for details.
                 comparison function object (i.e. an object that satisfies the
                 requirements of Compare) which returns true if the first argument is
                 less than (i.e. is ordered before) the second.

                 The signature of the comparison function should be equivalent to the
                 following:
   comp        -
                  bool cmp(const Type1 &a, const Type2 &b);

                 The signature does not need to have const &, but the function object
                 must not modify the objects passed to it.
                 The types Type1 and Type2 must be such that an object of type RandomIt
                 can be dereferenced and then implicitly converted to both of them. 
.SH Type requirements
   -
   RandomIt must meet the requirements of ValueSwappable and RandomAccessIterator.
   -
   The type of dereferenced RandomIt must meet the requirements of MoveAssignable and
   MoveConstructible.

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Complexity

   Approximately (last-first)log(middle-first) applications of cmp

.SH Exceptions

   The overloads with a template parameter named ExecutionPolicy report errors as
   follows:

     * If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws an exception
       and ExecutionPolicy is one of the three standard policies, std::terminate is
       called. For any other ExecutionPolicy, the behavior is implementation-defined.
     * If the algorithm fails to allocate memory, std::bad_alloc is thrown.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <algorithm>
 #include <functional>
 #include <array>
 #include <iostream>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::array<int, 10> s{5, 7, 4, 2, 8, 6, 1, 9, 0, 3};
  
     std::partial_sort(s.begin(), s.begin() + 3, s.end());
     for (int a : s) {
         std::cout << a << " ";
     }
 }

.SH Possible output:

 0 1 2 7 8 6 5 9 4 3
