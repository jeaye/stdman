.TH std::exception 3 "2024.06.10" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::exception \- std::exception

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <exception>
   class exception;

   Provides consistent interface to handle errors through the throw expression.

   All exceptions generated by the standard library inherit from std::exception.

.SH Member functions

   constructor   constructs the exception object
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
   destructor    destroys the exception object
   \fB[virtual]\fP     \fI(virtual public member function)\fP
   operator=     copies exception object
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
   what          returns an explanatory string
   \fB[virtual]\fP     \fI(virtual public member function)\fP

   Standard exception requirements

   Each standard library class T that derives from std::exception has the following
   publicly accessible member functions, each of them
   do not exit with an exception
   \fI(until C++11)\fP
   having a non-throwing exception specification
   \fI(since C++11)\fP:

     * default constructor (unless other constructors are provided)
     * copy constructor
     * copy assignment operator

   The copy constructor and the copy assignment operator meet the following
   postcondition:

     * If two objects lhs and rhs both have dynamic type T and lhs is a copy of rhs,
       then std::strcmp(lhs.what(), rhs.what()) is equal to 0.

   The what() member function of each such T satisfies the constraints specified for
   std::exception::what().
