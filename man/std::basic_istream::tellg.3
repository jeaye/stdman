.SH NAME
std::basic_istream::tellg \- std::basic_istream::tellg

.SH Synopsis
   pos_type tellg();

   Returns input position indicator of the current associated streambuf object.

   Behaves as UnformattedInputFunction, except that gcount() is not affected. After
   constructing and checking the sentry object, if fail() == true, returns
   pos_type(-1). Otherwise, returns rdbuf()->pubseekoff(0, std::ios_base::cur,
   std::ios_base::in).

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   The current position of the get pointer on success, pos_type(-1) on failure

.SH Exceptions

   
   failure if an error occurred (the error state flag is not goodbit) and exceptions()
   is set to throw for that state.

   If an internal operation throws an exception, it is caught and badbit is set. If
   exceptions() is set for badbit, the exception is rethrown.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <string>
 #include <sstream>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::string str = "Hello, world";
     std::istringstream in(str);
     std::string word;
     in >> word;
     std::cout << "After reading the word \\"" << word
               << "\\" tellg() returns " << in.tellg() << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 After reading the word "Hello," tellg() returns 6
