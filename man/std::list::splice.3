   Moves elements from one list to another.

   No elements are copied. The behavior is undefined if: get_allocator() !=
   other.get_allocator(). No iterators or references become invalidated, the iterators
   to moved elements now refer into *this, not into other.

   1) Moves all elements from other into *this. The elements are inserted before the
   element pointed to by pos. The container other becomes empty after the operation.
   The behavior is undefined if this == &other.
   2) Moves the element pointed to by it from other into *this. The element is inserted
   before the element pointed to by pos.
   3) Moves the elements in the range [first, last) from other into *this. The elements
   are inserted before the element pointed to by pos. The behavior is undefined if pos
   is an iterator in the range [first,last).

.SH Parameters

   pos         - element before which the content will be inserted
   other       - another container to move the content from
   it          - the element to move from other to *this
   first, last - the range of elements to move from other to *this

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Complexity

   1-2) Constant.

   3) Constant if this == &other, otherwise linear in std::distance(first, last).

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <list>

 std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& ostr, const std::list<int>& list)
 {
     for (auto &i : list) {
         ostr << " " << i;
     }
     return ostr;
 }

 int main ()
 {
     std::list<int> list1 = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
     std::list<int> list2 = { 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 };

     auto it = list1.begin();
     std::advance(it, 2);

     list1.splice(it, list2);

     std::cout << "list1: " << list1 << "\\n";
     std::cout << "list2: " << list2 << "\\n";

     list2.splice(list2.begin(), list1, it, list1.end());

     std::cout << "list1: " << list1 << "\\n";
     std::cout << "list2: " << list2 << "\\n";
 }

.SH Output:

 list1:  1 2 10 20 30 40 50 3 4 5
 list2:
 list1:  1 2 10 20 30 40 50
 list2:  3 4 5
