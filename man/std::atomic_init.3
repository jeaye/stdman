   Defined in header <atomic>
   template< class T >

   void atomic_init                                               \fI(since C++11)\fP
       ( std::atomic<T>* obj,                                 \fB(1)\fP (deprecated in C++20)

   void atomic_init                                               \fI(since C++11)\fP
       ( volatile std::atomic<T>* obj,                        \fB(2)\fP (deprecated in C++20)

         typename std::atomic<T>::value_type desired )
   noexcept;

   Initializes the default-constructed atomic object obj with the value desired. The
   function is not atomic: concurrent access from another thread, even through an
   atomic operation, is a data race.

   If obj was not default-constructed, or this function is called twice on the same
   obj, the behavior is undefined.

.SH Parameters

   obj     - pointer to an atomic object to initialize
   desired - the value to initialize atomic object with

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Notes

   This function is provided for compatibility with C. If the compatibility is not
   required, std::atomic may be initialized through their non-default constructors.

   Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to
   previously published C++ standards.

     DR    Applied to         Behavior as published         Correct behavior
   P0558R1 C++11      exact type match was required because T is only deduced
                      T was deduced from multiple arguments from obj
