.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <atomic>
   template< class T >

   void atomic_init( std::atomic<T>* obj,                                 \fI(since C++11)\fP

                     typename std::atomic<T>::value_type desired )
   noexcept;
   template< class T >

   void atomic_init( volatile std::atomic<T>* obj,                        \fI(since C++11)\fP

                     typename std::atomic<T>::value_type desired )
   noexcept;

   Initializes the default-constructed atomic object obj with the value desired. The
   function is not atomic: concurrent access from another thread, even through an
   atomic operation, is a data race.

   If obj was not default-constructed, the behavior is undefined.

   If this function is called twice on the same obj, the behavior is undefined.

.SH Parameters

   obj     - pointer to an atomic object to initialize
   desired - the value to initialize atomic object with

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Notes

   This function is provided for compatibility with C. If the compatibility is not
   required, std::atomic may be initialized through their non-default constructors.
