   Atomically replaces the current value of the referenced object with the result of
   computation involving the previous value and arg. These operations are
   read-modify-write operations.

   1) Performs atomic addition. Equivalent to return fetch_add(arg) + arg;.
   2) Performs atomic subtraction. Equivalent to return fetch_sub(arg) - arg;.
   3) Performs atomic bitwise and. Equivalent to return fetch_and(arg) & arg;.
   4) Performs atomic bitwise or. Equivalent to return fetch_or(arg) | arg;.
   5) Performs atomic bitwise exclusive or. Equivalent to return fetch_xor(arg) ^ arg;.

   For signed integral types, arithmetic is defined to use two’s complement
   representation. There are no undefined results.

   For floating-point types, the floating-point environment in effect may be different
   from the calling thread's floating-point environment. The operation need not be
   conform to the corresponding std::numeric_limits traits but is encouraged to do so.
   If the result is not a representable value for its type, the result is unspecified
   but the operation otherwise has no undefined behavior.

   For T* types, the result may be an undefined address, but the operations otherwise
   have no undefined behavior. The program is ill-formed if T is not an object type.

.SH Parameters

   arg - the argument for the arithmetic operation

.SH Return value

   The resulting value (that is, the result of applying the corresponding binary
   operator to the value immediately preceding the effects of the corresponding member
   function).

.SH Notes

   Unlike most compound assignment operators, the compound assignment operators for
   atomic_ref do not return a reference to their left-hand arguments. They return a
   copy of the stored value instead.
