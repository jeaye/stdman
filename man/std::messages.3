std::messages \- std::messages

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <locale>
   template< class CharT >
   class messages;

   Class template std::messages is a standard locale facet that encapsulates retrieval
   of strings from message catalogs, such as the ones provided by GNU gettext or by
   POSIX catgets.

   The source of the messages is implementation-defined.

   Two standalone (locale-independent) specializations are provided by the standard
   library:

   Defined in header <locale>
   std::messages<char>    accesses narrow string message catalog
   std::messages<wchar_t> accesses wide string message catalog

   In addition, every locale object constructed in a C++ program implements its own
   (locale-specific) versions of these specializations.
