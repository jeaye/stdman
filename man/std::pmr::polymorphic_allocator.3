.SH NAME
std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator \- std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <memory_resource>
   template< class T >                  \fI(since C++17)\fP
   class polymorphic_allocator;         \fI(until C++20)\fP
   template< class T = std::byte >      \fI(since C++20)\fP
   class polymorphic_allocator;

   The class template std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator is an Allocator which exhibits
   different allocation behavior depending upon the std::pmr::memory_resource from
   which it is constructed. Since memory_resource uses runtime polymorphism to manage
   allocations, different container instances with polymorphic_allocator as their
   static allocator type are interoperable, but can behave as if they had different
   allocator types.

   All specializations of polymorphic_allocator meet the Allocator completeness
   requirements.

   (removed in C++20)

.SH Notes

   polymorphic_allocator does not propagate on container copy assignment, move
   assignment, or swap. As a result, move assignment of a polymorphic_allocator-using
   container can throw, and swapping two polymorphic_allocator-using containers whose
   allocators do not compare equal results in undefined behavior.
