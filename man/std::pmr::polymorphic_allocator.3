std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator \- std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <memory_resource>
   template< class T >                  \fI(since C++17)\fP
   class polymorphic_allocator;

   The class template std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator is an Allocator whose allocation
   behavior depends on the memory resource it is constructed with. Thus, different
   instances of polymorphic_allocator can exhibit entirely different allocation
   behavior. This runtime polymorphism allows objects using polymorphic_allocator to
   behave as if they used different allocator types at run time despite the identical
   static allocator type.

.SH Notes

   polymorphic_allocator does not propagate on container copy assignment, move
   assignment, or swap. As a result, move assignment of a polymorphic_allocator-using
   container can throw, and swapping two polymorphic_allocator-using containers whose
   allocators do not compare equal results in undefined behavior.
