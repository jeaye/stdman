.TH std::wcspbrk 3 "2022.07.31" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::wcspbrk \- std::wcspbrk

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cwchar>
   const wchar_t* wcspbrk( const wchar_t* dest, const wchar_t* str );
   wchar_t* wcspbrk( wchar_t* dest, const wchar_t* str );

   Finds the first character in wide string pointed to by dest, that is also in wide
   string pointed to by str.

.SH Parameters

   dest - pointer to the null-terminated wide string to be analyzed
   src  - pointer to the null-terminated wide string that contains the characters to
          search for

.SH Return value

   Pointer to the first character in dest, that is also in str, or a null pointer if no
   such character exists.

.SH Notes

   The name stands for "wide character string pointer break", because it returns a
   pointer to the first of the separator ("break") characters.

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <cwchar>
 #include <iomanip>

 int main()
 {
     const wchar_t* str = L"Hello world, friend of mine!";
     const wchar_t* sep = L" ,!";

     unsigned int cnt = 0;
     do {
        str = std::wcspbrk(str, sep); // find separator
        std::wcout << std::quoted(str) << L'\\n';
        if (str) str += std::wcsspn(str, sep); // skip separator
        ++cnt; // increment word count
     } while (str && *str);

     std::wcout << L"There are " << cnt << L" words\\n";
 }

.SH Output:

 " world, friend of mine!"
 ", friend of mine!"
 " of mine!"
 " mine!"
 "!"
 There are 5 words
