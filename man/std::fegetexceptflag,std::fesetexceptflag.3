.SH NAME
std::fegetexceptflag,std::fesetexceptflag \- std::fegetexceptflag,std::fesetexceptflag

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cfenv>
   int fegetexceptflag( std::fexcept_t* flagp, int excepts );       \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   int fesetexceptflag( const std::fexcept_t* flagp, int excepts ); \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   1) Attempts to obtain the full contents of the floating-point exception flags that
   are listed in the bitmask argument excepts, which is a bitwise OR of the floating
   point exception macros.

   2) Attempts to copy the full contents of the floating-point exception flags that are
   listed in excepts from flagp into the floating-point environment. Does not raise any
   exceptions, only modifies the flags.

   The full contents of a floating-point exception flag is not necessarily a boolean
   value indicating whether the exception is raised or cleared. For example, it may be
   a struct which includes the boolean status and the address of the code that
   triggered the exception. These functions obtain all such content and obtain/store it
   in flagp in implementation-defined format.

.SH Parameters

   flagp   - pointer to an std::fexcept_t object where the flags will be stored or read
             from
   excepts - bitmask listing the exception flags to get/set

.SH Return value

   0 on success, non-zero otherwise.
