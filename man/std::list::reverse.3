.SH NAME
std::list::reverse \- std::list::reverse

.SH Synopsis
   void reverse();  (noexcept since C++11)

   Reverses the order of the elements in the container. No references or iterators
   become invalidated.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Complexity

   Linear in the size of the container.

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <list>

 std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& ostr, const std::list<int>& list)
 {
     for (auto& i : list)
         ostr << ' ' << i;
     return ostr;
 }

 int main()
 {
     std::list<int> list = {8, 7, 5, 9, 0, 1, 3, 2, 6, 4};
     std::cout << "initially: " << list << '\\n';

     list.sort();
     std::cout << "ascending: " << list << '\\n';

     list.reverse();
     std::cout << "descending:" << list << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 initially:  8 7 5 9 0 1 3 2 6 4
 ascending:  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
 descending: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
