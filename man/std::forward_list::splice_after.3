   void splice_after( const_iterator pos, forward_list&& other,    \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
                      const_iterator it );
   void splice_after( const_iterator pos, forward_list& other,     \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
                      const_iterator first, const_iterator last );
   void splice_after( const_iterator pos, forward_list&& other,    \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
                      const_iterator first, const_iterator last );

   Moves elements from another forward_list to *this.

   No elements are copied. pos is a valid iterator in *this or is the before_begin()
   iterator. The behavior is undefined if get_allocator() != other.get_allocator(). No
   iterators or references become invalidated, the iterators to the moved elements now
   refer into *this, not into other.

   1) Moves all elements from other into *this. The elements are inserted after the
   element pointed to by pos. The container other becomes empty after the operation.
   The behavior is undefined if this == &other
   2) Moves the element pointed to by the iterator following it from other into *this.
   The element is inserted after the element pointed to by pos. Has no effect if
   pos==it or if pos==++it.
   3) Moves the elements in the range (first, last) from other into *this. The elements
   are inserted after the element pointed to by pos. The element pointed-to by first is
   not moved. The behavior is undefined if pos is an iterator in the range
   (first,last).

.SH Parameters

   pos         - element after which the content will be inserted
   other       - another container to move the content from
   it          - iterator preceding the iterator to the element to move from other to
                 *this
   first, last - the range of elements to move from other to *this

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Complexity

   1) Linear in the size of other
   2) Constant
   3) Linear in std::distance(first, last)

.SH Example

   Demonstrates the meaning of open interval (first, last) in the third form of
   splice_after(): the first element of l1 is not moved.

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <forward_list>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::forward_list<int> l1 = {1,2,3,4,5};
     std::forward_list<int> l2 = {10,11,12};
  
     l2.splice_after(l2.cbegin(), l1, l1.cbegin(), l1.cend());
     // not equivalent to l2.splice_after(l2.cbegin(), l1);
  
     for(int n : l1)
         std::cout << n << ' ';
     std::cout << '\\n';
  
     for(int n : l2)
         std::cout << n << ' ';
     std::cout << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 1
 10 2 3 4 5 11 12
