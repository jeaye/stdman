std::DerivedFrom \- std::DerivedFrom

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <concepts>
   template< class Derived, class Base >

   concept DerivedFrom =
     std::is_base_of_v<Base, Derived> &&                                  \fI(since C++20)\fP

     std::is_convertible_v<const volatile Derived*, const volatile
   Base*>;

   The concept DerivedFrom<Derived, Base> is satisfied if and only if Base is a class
   type that is either Derived or a public and unambiguous base of Derived, ignoring
   cv-qualifiers.

   Note that this behaviour is different to std::is_base_of when Base is a private or
   protected base of Derived.
