.SH Synopsis

   directory_iterator& operator++();                      \fI(since C++17)\fP
   directory_iterator& increment( std::error_code& ec );

   Advances the iterator to the next entry. Invalidates all copies of the previous
   value of *this.

.SH Parameters

   ec - error code to store error status to

.SH Return value

   *this

.SH Exceptions

   The overload that does not take a std::error_code& parameter throws filesystem_error
   on underlying OS API errors, constructed with the OS error code as the error code
   argument. The overload taking a std::error_code& parameter sets it to the OS API
   error code if an OS API call fails, and executes ec.clear() if no errors occur. Any
   overload not marked noexcept may throw std::bad_alloc if memory allocation fails.
