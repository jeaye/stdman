.TH std::memchr 3 "2021.11.17" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::memchr \- std::memchr

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstring>
   const void* memchr( const void* ptr, int ch, std::size_t count );
   void* memchr(       void* ptr, int ch, std::size_t count );

   Converts ch to unsigned char and locates the first occurrence of that value in the
   initial count characters (each interpreted as unsigned char) of the object pointed
   to by ptr.

   This function behaves as if it reads the characters sequentially and
   stops as soon as a matching character is found: if the array pointed   \fI(since C++17)\fP
   to by ptr is smaller than count, but the match is found within the
   array, the behavior is well-defined

.SH Parameters

   ptr   - pointer to the object to be examined
   ch    - character to search for
   count - max number of characters to examine

.SH Return value

   Pointer to the location of the character, or a null pointer if no such character is
   found.

.SH Example

   Search an array of characters.


// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <cstring>

 int main()
 {
     char arr[] = {'a','\\0','a','A','a','a','A','a'};
     char *pc = (char*)std::memchr(arr,'A',sizeof arr);
     if (pc != NULL)
        std::cout << "search character found\\n";
     else
        std::cout << "search character not found\\n";
 }

.SH Output:

 search character found
