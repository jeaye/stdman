.SH NAME
std::experimental::ranges::swap(ranges::tagged) \- std::experimental::ranges::swap(ranges::tagged)

.SH Synopsis
   friend constexpr void swap(tagged& lhs, tagged& rhs)
   noexcept(noexcept(lhs.swap(rhs)))
   requires Swappable<Base>;

   Swap the contents of *this and rhs, as if by lhs.swap(rhs);.

   This function is a hidden friend: it is not visible to ordinary unqualified or
   qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when tagged is
   an associated class of the arguments.

.SH Notes

   Unlike most non-member swaps in the standard library, this swap is a hidden friend
   function declared in the body of tagged, not a function template. The tagged in the
   function declaration is the injected-class-name.
