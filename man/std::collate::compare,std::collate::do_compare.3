.SH NAME
std::collate::compare,std::collate::do_compare \- std::collate::compare,std::collate::do_compare

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <locale>
   public:

   int compare( const CharT* low1, const CharT* high1,                    \fB(1)\fP

                const CharT* low2, const CharT* high2 ) const;
   protected:

   virtual int do_compare( const CharT* low1, const CharT* high1,         \fB(2)\fP

                           const CharT* low2, const CharT* high2 ) const;

   1) Public member function, calls the protected virtual member function do_compare of
   the most derived class.
   2) Compares the character sequence [low1, high1) to the character sequence [low2,
   high2), using this locale's collation rules, and returns 1 if the first string
   follows the second, -1 if the first string precedes the second, zero if the two
   strings are equivalent.

.SH Parameters

   low1  - pointer to the first character of the first string
   high1 - one past the end pointer for the first string
   low2  - pointer to the first character of the second string
   high2 - one past the end pointer for the second string

.SH Return value

   1 if the first string is greater than the second (that is, follows the second in the
   collation order), -1 if the first string is less than the second (precedes the
   second in the collation order), zero if the two strings are equivalent.

.SH Notes

   When three-way comparison is not required (such as when providing a Compare argument
   to standard algorithms such as std::sort), std::locale::operator() may be more
   appropriate.

   Collation order is the dictionary order: the position of the letter in the national
   alphabet (its equivalence class) has higher priority than its case or variant.
   Within an equivalence class, lowercase characters collate before their uppercase
   equivalents and locale-specific order may apply to the characters with diacritics.
   In some locales, groups of characters compare as single collation units. For
   example, "ch" in Czech follows "h" and precedes "i", and "dzs" in Hungarian follows
   "dz" and precedes "g".

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <string>
 #include <locale>
  
 template<typename CharT>
 void try_compare(const std::locale& l, const CharT* p1, const CharT* p2)
 {
     auto& f = std::use_facet<std::collate<CharT>>(l);
  
     std::basic_string<CharT> s1(p1), s2(p2);
     if(f.compare(&s1[0], &s1[0] + s1.size(),
                  &s2[0], &s2[0] + s2.size() ) < 0)
          std::wcout << p1 << " before " << p2 << '\\n';
     else
          std::wcout << p2 << " before " << p1 << '\\n';
 }
  
 int main()
 {
     std::locale::global(std::locale("en_US.utf8"));
     std::wcout.imbue(std::locale());
  
     std::wcout << "In the American locale: ";
     try_compare(std::locale(), "hrnec", "chrt");
     std::wcout << "In the Czech locale: ";
     try_compare(std::locale("cs_CZ.utf8"), "hrnec", "chrt");
  
     std::wcout << "In the American locale: ";
     try_compare(std::locale(), L"år", L"ängel");
     std::wcout << "In the Swedish locale: ";
     try_compare(std::locale("sv_SE.utf8"), L"år", L"ängel");
 }

.SH Output:

 In the American locale: chrt before hrnec
 In the Czech locale: hrnec before chrt
 In the American locale: ängel before år
 In the Swedish locale: år before ängel
