   Constructs a monotonic_buffer_resource. The constructors not taking a upstream
   memory resource pointer uses the return value of std::pmr::get_default_resource as
   the upstream memory resource.

   1-2) Sets the current buffer to null and the next buffer size to an
   implementation-defined size.
   3-4) Sets the current buffer to null and the next buffer size to a size no smaller
   than initial_size.
   5-6) Sets the current buffer to buffer and the next buffer size to buffer_size (but
   not less than 1). Then increase the next buffer size by an implementation-defined
   growth factor (which does not have to be integral).
   7) Copy constructor is deleted.

.SH Parameters

   upstream     - the upstream memory resource to use; must point to a valid memory
                  resource
   initial_size - the minimum size of the first buffer to allocate; must be greater
                  than zero
   buffer       - the initial buffer to use
   buffer_size  - the size of the initial buffer; cannot be greater than the number of
                  bytes in buffer
