   move_iterator<U>& other );

   Constructs a new iterator adaptor.

   1) Default constructor. The underlying iterator is value-initialized. Operations on
   the resulting iterator have defined behavior if and only if the corresponding
   operations on a value-initialized Iter also have defined behavior.
   2) The underlying iterator is initialized with
   x
   \fI(until C++20)\fP
   std::move(x)
   \fI(since C++20)\fP.
   3) The underlying iterator is initialized with that of other.
   The behavior is undefined if U is not convertible to Iter
   \fI(until C++20)\fP
   This overload participates in overload resolution only if U is not the same type as
   Iter and std::convertible_to<const U&, Iter> is modeled
   \fI(since C++20)\fP.

.SH Parameters

   x     - iterator to adapt
