.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <array>

   class T,                   \fI(since C++11)\fP
   std::size_t N

   > struct array;

   std::array is a container that encapsulates fixed size arrays.

   This container is an aggregate type with the same semantics as a struct holding a
   C-style array T[N] as its only non-static data member. Unlike a C-style array, it
   doesn't decay to T* automatically. As an aggregate type, it can be initialized with
   aggregate-initialization given at most N initializers that are convertible to T:
   std::array<int, 3> a = {1,2,3};.

   The struct combines the performance and accessibility of a C-style array with the
   benefits of a standard container, such as knowing its own size, supporting
   assignment, random access iterators, etc.

   std::array satisfies the requirements of Container and ReversibleContainer except
   that default-constructed array is not empty and that the complexity of swapping is
   linear,
   satisfies the requirements of ContiguousContainer,
   \fI(since C++17)\fP and partially satisfies the requirements of SequenceContainer.

   There is a special case for a zero-length array (N == 0). In that case,
   array.begin() == array.end(), which is some unique value. The effect of calling
   front() or back() on a zero-sized array is undefined.

   An array can also be used as a tuple of N elements of the same type.

  Iterator invalidation

   As a rule, iterators to an array are never invalidated throughout the lifetime of
   the array. One should take note, however, that during swap, the iterator will
   continue to point to the same array element, and will thus change its value.

// Run this code

 #include <string>
 #include <iterator>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <algorithm>
 #include <array>

 int main()
 {
     // construction uses aggregate initialization
     std::array<int, 3> a1{ {1, 2, 3} }; // double-braces required in C++11 prior to the CWG 1270 revision
                                         // (not needed in C++11 after the revision and in C++14 and beyond)
     std::array<int, 3> a2 = {1, 2, 3};  // never required after =
     std::array<std::string, 2> a3 = { std::string("a"), "b" };

     // container operations are supported
     std::sort(a1.begin(), a1.end());
     std::reverse_copy(a2.begin(), a2.end(),
                       std::ostream_iterator<int>(std::cout, " "));
