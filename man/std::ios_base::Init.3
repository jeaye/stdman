.SH Synopsis
   class Init;

   This class is used to ensure that the default C++ streams (std::cin, std::cout,
   etc.) are properly initialized and destructed. The class tracks how many instances
   of it are created and initializes the C++ streams when the first instance is
   constructed as well as flushes the output streams when the last instance is
   destructed.

   The header <iostream> behaves as if it defines (directly or indirectly) an instance
   of std::ios_base::Init with static storage duration: this makes it safe to access
   the standard I/O streams in the constructors and destructors of static objects with
   ordered initialization (as long as #include <iostream> is included in the
   translation unit before these objects were defined)
