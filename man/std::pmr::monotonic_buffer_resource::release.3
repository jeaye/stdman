.SH Synopsis
   void release();  \fI(since C++17)\fP

   Releases all allocated memory by calling the deallocate function on the upstream
   memory resource as necessary. Resets current buffer and next buffer size to their
   initial values at construction.

   Memory is released back to the upstream resource even if deallocate has not been
   called for some of the allocated blocks.
