.SH Synopsis
   constexpr size_type find_first_of(basic_string_view v, size_type   \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   pos = 0) const noexcept;
   constexpr size_type find_first_of(CharT c, size_type pos = 0)      \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   const noexcept;
   constexpr size_type find_first_of(const CharT* s, size_type pos,   \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   size_type count) const;
   constexpr size_type find_first_of(const CharT* s, size_type pos =  \fB(4)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   0) const;

   Finds the first character equal to any of the characters in the given character
   sequence.

   1) Finds the first occurence of any of the characters of v in this view, starting at
   position pos.
   2) Equivalent to find_first_of(basic_string_view(&c, 1), pos).
   3) Equivalent to find_first_of(basic_string_view(s, count), pos).
   4) Equivalent to find_first_of(basic_string_view(s), pos).

.SH Parameters

   v     - view to search for
   pos   - position at which to start the search
   count - length of the string of characters to search for
   s     - pointer to a string of characters to search for
   ch    - character to search for

.SH Return value

   Position of the first occurrence of any character of the substring, or npos if no
   such character is found.

.SH Complexity

   O(size() * v.size()) at worst.
