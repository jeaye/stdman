.SH NAME
std::filesystem::perms \- std::filesystem::perms

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <filesystem>
   enum class perms;               \fI(since C++17)\fP

   This type represents file access permissions. perms satisfies the requirements of
   BitmaskType (which means the bitwise operators operator&, operator|, operator^,
   operator~, operator&=, operator|=, and operator^= are defined for this type)

   Access permissions model POSIX permission bits, and any individual file permissions
   (as reported by status) are a combination of some of the following bits:

   Additionally, the following constants of this type are defined, which do not
   represent permissions:

   Member constant Value (hex)                         Meaning
   unknown         0xFFFF      Unknown permissions (e.g. when file_status is created
                               without permissions)

.SH Notes

   Permissions may not necessarily be implemented as bits, but they are treated that
   way conceptually.

   Some permission bits may be ignored on some systems, and changing some bits may
   automatically change others (e.g. on platforms without owner/group/all distinction,
   setting any of the three write bits set all three)

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <fstream>
 #include <bitset>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <filesystem>
 namespace fs = std::filesystem;
  
 void demo_perms(fs::perms p)
 {
     std::cout << ((p & fs::perms::owner_read) != fs::perms::none ? "r" : "-")
               << ((p & fs::perms::owner_write) != fs::perms::none ? "w" : "-")
               << ((p & fs::perms::owner_exec) != fs::perms::none ? "x" : "-")
               << ((p & fs::perms::group_read) != fs::perms::none ? "r" : "-")
               << ((p & fs::perms::group_write) != fs::perms::none ? "w" : "-")
               << ((p & fs::perms::group_exec) != fs::perms::none ? "x" : "-")
               << ((p & fs::perms::others_read) != fs::perms::none ? "r" : "-")
               << ((p & fs::perms::others_write) != fs::perms::none ? "w" : "-")
               << ((p & fs::perms::others_exec) != fs::perms::none ? "x" : "-")
               << '\\n';
 }
 int main()
 {
     std::ofstream("test.txt"); // create file
  
     std::cout << "Created file with permissions: ";
     demo_perms(fs::status("test.txt").permissions());
  
     fs::permissions("test.txt",
                     fs::perms::owner_all | fs::perms::group_all,
                     fs::perm_options::add);
  
     std::cout << "After adding o+rwx and g+rwx:  ";
     demo_perms(fs::status("test.txt").permissions());
  
     fs::remove("test.txt");
 }

.SH Possible output:

 Created file with permissions: rw-r--r--
 After adding o+rwx and g+wrx:  rwxrwxr--
