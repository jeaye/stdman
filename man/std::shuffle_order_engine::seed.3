std::shuffle_order_engine::seed \- std::shuffle_order_engine::seed

.SH Synopsis
   void seed();                    \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   void seed( result_type value ); \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   template< class Sseq >          \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   void seed( Sseq& seq );

   Reinitializes the internal state of the underlying engine using a new seed value.

   1) Seeds the underlying engine with the default seed value. Effectively calls
   e.seed(), where e is the underlying engine.
   2) Seeds the underlying engine with the seed value s. Effectively calls
   e.seed(value), where e is the underlying engine.
   3) Seeds the underlying engine with the seed sequence seq. Effectively calls
   e.seed(seq), where e is the underlying engine. This template only participate in
   overload resolution if Sseq qualifies as a SeedSequence. In particular, this
   template does not participate in overload resolution if Sseq is implicitly
   convertible to result_type.

.SH Parameters

   value - seed value to use in the initialization of the internal state of the
           underlying engine
   seq   - seed sequence to use in the initialization of the internal state of the
           underlying engine

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Exceptions

   Throws nothing.
