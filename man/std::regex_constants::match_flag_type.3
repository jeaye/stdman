   match_flag_type is a BitmaskType that specifies additional regular expression
   matching options.

.SH Constants

   Note: [first, last) refers to the character sequence being matched.

   Constant          Explanation
                     The first character in [first,last) will be treated as if it is
   match_not_bol     not at the beginning of a line (i.e. ^ will not match
                     [first,first)
   match_not_eol     The last character in [first,last) will be treated as if it is not
                     at the end of a line (i.e. $ will not match [last,last)
   match_not_bow     "\\b" will not match [first,first)
   match_not_eow     "\\b" will not match [last,last)
   match_any         If more than one match is possible, then any match is an
                     acceptable result
   match_not_null    Do not match empty sequences
   match_continuous  Only match a sub-sequence that begins at first
   match_prev_avail  --first is a valid iterator position. When set, causes
                     match_not_bol and match_not_bow to be ignored
   format_default    Use ECMAScript rules to construct strings in std::regex_replace
                     (syntax documentation)
   format_sed        Use POSIX sed utility rules in std::regex_replace. (syntax
                     documentation)
   format_no_copy    Do not copy un-matched strings to the output in std::regex_replace
   format_first_only Only replace the first match in std::regex_replace

   All constants, except for match_default and format_default, are bitmask elements.
   The match_default and format_default constants are empty bitmasks

.SH Notes

   In C++11, these constants were specified with redundant keyword static, which was
   removed by C++14 via LWG issue 2053
