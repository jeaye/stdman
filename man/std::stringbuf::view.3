.SH NAME
std::basic_stringbuf::view \- std::basic_stringbuf::view

.SH Synopsis
   std::basic_string_view<CharT, Traits> view() const noexcept;  \fI(since C++20)\fP

   Creates and returns a std::basic_string_view over the underlying character sequence.

     * For input-only streams, the returned view represents the range [eback(),
       egptr()).
     * For input/output or output-only streams, references the characters from pbase()
       to the last character in the sequence regardless of egptr() and epptr().
     * If the stream is neither input nor output, returns std::basic_string_view<CharT,
       Traits>{}.

   The member character sequence in a buffer open for writing can be over-allocated for
   efficiency purposes. In that case, only the initialized characters are referenced:
   these characters are the ones that were obtained from the string argument of the
   constructor, the string argument used by the most recent call to a setter overload
   of str(), or from an write operation. A typical implementation that uses
   over-allocation maintains a high-watermark pointer to track the end of the
   initialized part of the buffer and the returned view references the characters from
   pbase() to the high-watermark pointer.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   A view over the underlying character sequence.

.SH Notes

   Using of the return value is undefined behavior if the underlying character sequence
   is destroyed or invalidated, unless the return value is empty.

   This function is typically accessed through std::basic_istringstream::view(),
   std::basic_ostringstream::view(), or std::basic_stringstream::view().
