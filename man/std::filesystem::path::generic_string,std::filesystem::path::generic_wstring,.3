   Returns the internal pathname in generic pathname format, converted to specific
   string type. Conversion, if any, is specified as follows:



     * If path::value_type is char, conversion, if any, is system-dependent. This is
       the case on typical POSIX systems (such as Linux), where native encoding is
       UTF-8 and string() performs no conversion.
     * Otherwise, if path::value_type is wchar_t, conversion, if any, is unspecified.
       This is the case on Windows, where wchar_t is 16 bit and the native encoding is
       UTF-16.
     * Otherwise, if path::value_type is char16_t, native encoding is UTF-16 and the
       conversion method is unspecified.
     * Otherwise, if path::value_type is char32_t, native encoding is UTF-32 and the
       conversion method is unspecified.
     * Otherwise, if path::value_type is char8_t, native encoding is UTF-8 and the
       conversion method is unspecified.

   The / character is used as the directory separator.

   1) All memory allocations are performed by a.
   3) The result encoding in the case of u8string() is always UTF-8.

.SH Parameters

   a                -                allocator to construct the string with
.SH Type requirements
   -
   CharT must be one of the encoded character types (char, wchar_t, char16_t and
   char32_t)

.SH Return value

   The internal pathname in generic pathname format, converted to specified string
   type.

.SH Exceptions

   May throw implementation-defined exceptions.
