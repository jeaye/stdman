   Finds the first character equal to one of the characters in the given character
   sequence. The search considers only the interval [pos, size()). If the character is
   not present in the interval, npos will be returned.

   1) Finds the first character equal to one of the characters in str
   as if by find_first_of(std::basic_string_view<CharT, Traits>(str), pos)
   \fI(since C++17)\fP
   2) Finds the first character equal to one of the characters in the first count
   characters of the character string pointed to by s. s can include null characters.
   Equivalent to
   find_first_of(basic_string(s, count), pos)
   \fI(until C++17)\fP
   find_first_of(std::basic_string_view<CharT, Traits>(s, count), pos)
   \fI(since C++17)\fP
   3) Finds the first character equal to one of the characters in character string
   pointed to by s. The length of the string is determined by the first null character.
   Equivalent to
   find_first_of(basic_string(s), pos)
   \fI(until C++17)\fP
   find_first_of(std::basic_string_view<CharT,Traits>(s), pos)
   \fI(since C++17)\fP
   4) Finds the first character equal to ch.
   5) Finds the first character equal to one of the characters in sv

.SH Parameters

   str   - string identifying characters to search for
   pos   - position at which to begin searching
   count - length of character string identifying characters to search for
   s     - pointer to a character string identifying characters to search for
   ch    - character to search for
   sv    - std::basic_string_view to search for

.SH Return value

   Position of the found character or npos if no such character is found.

.SH Notes

   traits::eq() is used to perform the comparison.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <string>
  
 int main()
 {
     // the test string
     std::string str = std::string("Hello World!");
  
     // strings and chars to search for
     std::string search_str = std::string("o");
     const char* search_cstr = "Good Bye!";
  
     std::cout << str.find_first_of(search_str) << '\\n';
     std::cout << str.find_first_of(search_str, 5) << '\\n';
     std::cout << str.find_first_of(search_cstr) << '\\n';
     std::cout << str.find_first_of(search_cstr, 0, 4) << '\\n';
     // 'x' is not in "Hello World', thus it will return std::string::npos
     std::cout << str.find_first_of('x') << '\\n';
 }
