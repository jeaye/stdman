.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <stack>
   template<

       class T,
       class Container = std::deque<T>

   > class stack;

   The std::stack class is a container adapter that gives the programmer the
   functionality of a stack - specifically, a FILO (first-in, last-out) data structure.

   The class template acts as a wrapper to the underlying container - only a specific
   set of functions is provided. The stack pushes and pops the element from the back of
   the underlying container, known as the top of the stack.

.SH Template parameters

   T         - The type of the stored elements.
               The type of the underlying container to use to store the elements. The
               container must satisfy the requirements of SequenceContainer.
               Additionally, it must provide the following functions with the usual
               semantics:

   Container -   * back()
                 * push_back()
                 * pop_back()

               The standard containers std::vector, std::deque and std::list satisfy
               these requirements.
