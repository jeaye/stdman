   Unordered multiset is an associative container that contains set of possibly
   non-unique objects of type Key. Search, insertion, and removal have average
   constant-time complexity.

   Internally, the elements are not sorted in any particular order, but organized into
   buckets. Which bucket an element is placed into depends entirely on the hash of its
   value. This allows fast access to individual elements, since once hash is computed,
   it refers to the exact bucket the element is placed into.

   The iteration order of this container is not required to be stable (so, for example,
   std::equal cannot be used to compare two std::unordered_multisets), except that
   every group of elements whose keys compare equivalent (compare equal with key_eq()
   as the comparator) forms a contiguous subrange in the iteration order, also
   accessible with equal_range().

   std::unordered_multiset meets the requirements of Container,
   AllocatorAwareContainer, UnorderedAssociativeContainer.

.SH Notes

   The member types iterator and const_iterator may be aliases to the same type. Since
   iterator is convertible to const_iterator, const_iterator should be used in function
   parameter lists to avoid violations of the One Definition Rule.
