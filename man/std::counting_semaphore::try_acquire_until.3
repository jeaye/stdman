.SH NAME
std::counting_semaphore::try_acquire_until \- std::counting_semaphore::try_acquire_until

.SH Synopsis
   template<class Clock, class Duration>
   bool try_acquire_until( const std::chrono::time_point<Clock,           \fI(since C++20)\fP
   Duration>& abs_time );

   Tries to atomically decrement the internal counter by 1 if it is greater than 0;
   otherwise blocks until it is greater than 0 and can successfully decrement the
   internal counter, or the abs_time time point has been passed.

.SH Preconditions

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Parameters

   abs_time - the earliest time the function must wait until in order to fail

.SH Return value

   true if it decremented the internal counter, otherwise false

.SH Exceptions

   May throw std::system_error or a timeout-related exception.

.SH Notes

   In practice the function may take longer than abs_time to fail.

   Implementations are allowed to fail to decrement the counter even if it was greater
   than 0 - i.e., they are allowed to spuriously fail and return false.
