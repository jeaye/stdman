.SH Synopsis
   std::experimental::shared_future<T>& operator=( const                           \fB(1)\fP
   std::experimental::shared_future<T>& other );
   std::experimental::shared_future<T>& operator=(                                 \fB(2)\fP
   std::experimental::shared_future<T>&& other ) noexcept;

   Assigns the contents of another std::experimental::shared_future object.

   1) Releases any shared state and assigns the contents of other to *this. After the
   assignment, this->valid() == other.valid().
   2) Releases any shared state and move-assigns the contents of other to *this. After
   the assignment, other.valid() == false and this->valid() will yield the same value
   as other.valid() before the assignment.

.SH Parameters

   other - a std::experimental::shared_future object to assign from

.SH Return value

   *this
