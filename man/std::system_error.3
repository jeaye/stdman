.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <system_error>
   class system_error;               \fI(since C++11)\fP

   std::system_error is the type of the exception thrown by various library functions
   (typically the functions that interface with the OS facilities, e.g. the constructor
   of std::thread), when the exception has an associated std::error_code which needs to
   be reported.
