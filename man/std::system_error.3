.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <thread>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <system_error>
  
 int main()
 {
     try {
         std::thread().detach(); // attempt to detach a non-thread
     } catch(const std::system_error& e) {
         std::cout << "Caught system_error with code " << e.code()
                   << " meaning " << e.what() << '\\n';
     }
 }
