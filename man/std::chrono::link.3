.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <chrono>
   class link;                 \fI(since C++20)\fP

   The class link represents an alternative name for a time zone.

   Users cannot construct link objects. The library implementation creates link objects
   when it initializes the time zone database and provides const access to these
   objects.

   link is not copyable but does have a defaulted move constructor and a defaulted move
   assignment operator. However, as users have only const access to link objects, these
   functions cannot be called in user code without invoking undefined behavior.
