.SH NAME
std::put_time \- std::put_time

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <iomanip>
   template< class CharT >                                            \fI(since C++11)\fP
   /*unspecified*/ put_time( const std::tm* tmb, const CharT* fmt );

   When used in an expression out << put_time(tmb, fmt), converts the date and time
   information from a given calendar time tmb to a character string according to format
   string fmt, as if by calling std::strftime, std::wcsftime, or analog (depending on
   CharT), according to the std::time_put facet of the locale currently imbued in the
   output stream out.

.SH Parameters

   tmb - pointer to the calendar time structure as obtained from localtime() or
         gmtime()
         pointer to a null-terminated CharT string specifying the format of conversion.

         The format string consists of zero or more conversion specifiers and ordinary
         characters (except %). All ordinary characters, including the terminating null
         character, are copied to the output string without modification. Each
         conversion specification begins with % character, optionally followed by E or
         O modifier (ignored if unsupported by the locale), followed by the character
         that determines the behavior of the specifier. The following format specifiers
         are available:

             %      writes literal %. The full conversion
                    specification must be %%.

   Returns an object of unspecified type such that if out is the name of an output
   stream of type std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>, then the expression out <<

   typedef std::ostreambuf_iterator<CharT, Traits> Iter;
