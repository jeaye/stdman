.SH NAME
std::put_time \- std::put_time

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <iomanip>
   template< class CharT >                                            \fI(since C++11)\fP
   /*unspecified*/ put_time( const std::tm* tmb, const CharT* fmt );

   When used in an expression out << put_time(tmb, fmt), converts the date and time
   information from a given calendar time tmb to a character string according to format
   string fmt, as if by calling std::strftime, std::wcsftime, or analog (depending on
   CharT), according to the std::time_put facet of the locale currently imbued in the
   output stream out.

.SH Parameters

   tmb - pointer to the calendar time structure as obtained from std::localtime or
         std::gmtime
   fmt - pointer to a null-terminated CharT string specifying the format of conversion

  Format string

   The format string consists of zero or more conversion specifiers and ordinary
   characters (except %). All ordinary characters, including the terminating null
   character, are copied to the output string without modification. Each conversion
   specification begins with % character, optionally followed by E or O modifier
   (ignored if unsupported by the locale), followed by the character that determines
   the behavior of the specifier. The following format specifiers are available:

   Conversion                       Explanation                          Used fields
   specifier
       %      writes literal %. The full conversion specification
              must be %%.

.SH Return value

   Returns an object of unspecified type such that if out is the name of an output
   stream of type std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>, then the expression out <<
   put_time(tmb, fmt) behaves as if the following code was executed:

   typedef std::ostreambuf_iterator<CharT, Traits> Iter;
   typedef std::time_put<CharT, Iter> TimePut;
   const TimePut& tp = std::use_facet<TimePut>(out.getloc());
   const Iter end = tp.put(Iter(out.rdbuf()), out, out.fill(), tmb, fmt, fmt +
   Traits::length(fmt));
   if (end.failed())
   out.setstate(std::ios_base::badbit);
