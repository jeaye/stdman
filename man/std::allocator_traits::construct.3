.TH std::allocator_traits::construct 3 "Jun 28 2014" "2.0 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <memory>
   template< class T, class... Args >                        \fI(since C++11)\fP
   static void construct( Alloc& a, T* p, Args&&... args );

   If possible, constructs an object of type T in allocated uninitialized storage
   pointed to by p, by calling

   a.construct(p, std::forward<Args>(args)...)

   If the above is not possible (e.g. a does not have the member function
   construct(),), then calls placement-new as

   ::new (static_cast<void*>(p)) T(std::forward<Args>(args)...)

.SH Parameters

   a       - allocator to use for construction
   args... - the constructor arguments to pass to a.construct() or to placement-new

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Notes

   This function is used by the standard library containers when inserting, copying, or
   moving elements.

   Because this function provides the automatic fall back to placement new, the member
   function construct() is an optional Allocator requirement since C++11.
