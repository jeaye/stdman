                                                                         \fI(since C++20)\fP

   std::remove_reference_t<ranges::range_reference_t</*CT*/>>* cdata(
   T&& t );

   Returns a pointer to the first element of a contiguous range denoted by a
   const-qualified argument.

   Let CT be

    1. const std::remove_reference_t<T>& if the argument is an lvalue (i.e. T is an
       lvalue reference type),
    2. const T otherwise,

   a call to ranges::cdata is expression-equivalent to
   ranges::data(static_cast<CT&&>(t)).

   If ranges::cdata(t) is valid, then it returns a pointer to a object.

  Expression-equivalent

   Expression e is expression-equivalent to expression f, if e and f have the same
   effects, either are both potentially-throwing or are both not potentially-throwing
   (i.e. noexcept(e) == noexcept(f)), and either are both constant subexpressions or
   are both not constant subexpressions.

  Customization point objects

   The name ranges::cdata denotes a customization point object, which is a const
   function object of a literal semiregular class type. For exposition purposes, the
   cv-unqualified version of its type is denoted as __cdata_fn.

   All instances of __cdata_fn are equal. The effects of invoking different instances
   of type __cdata_fn on the same arguments are equivalent, regardless of whether the
   expression denoting the instance is an lvalue or rvalue, and is const-qualified or
   not (however, a volatile-qualified instance is not required to be invocable). Thus,
   ranges::cdata can be copied freely and its copies can be used interchangeably.

   Given a set of types Args..., if std::declval<Args>()... meet the requirements for
   arguments to ranges::cdata above, __cdata_fn models std::invocable<__cdata_fn,
   Args...>, std::invocable<const __cdata_fn, Args...>, std::invocable<__cdata_fn&,
   Args...>, and std::invocable<const __cdata_fn&, Args...>. Otherwise, no function
   call operator of __cdata_fn participates in overload resolution.

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <cstring>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <ranges>
 #include <string>

 int main()
 {
     std::string src {"hello world!\\n"};

 //  std::ranges::cdata(src)[0] = 'H'; // error, src.data() is treated as read-only
     std::ranges::data(src)[0] = 'H'; // OK, src.data() is a non-const storage

     char dst[20]; // storage for a C-style string
     std::strcpy(dst, std::ranges::cdata(src));
     // [data(src), data(src) + size(src)] is guaranteed to be an NTBS

     std::cout << dst;
 }

.SH Output:

 Hello world!
