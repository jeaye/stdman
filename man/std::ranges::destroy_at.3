.TH std::ranges::destroy_at 3 "2022.07.31" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::ranges::destroy_at \- std::ranges::destroy_at

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <memory>
   Call signature
   template< std::destructible T >              \fI(since C++20)\fP
   constexpr void destroy_at( T* p ) noexcept;

   If T is not an array type, calls the destructor of the object pointed to by p, as if
   by p->~T(). Otherwise, recursively destroys elements of *p in order, as if by
   calling std::destroy(std::begin(*p), std::end(*p)).

   The function-like entities described on this page are niebloids, that is:

     * Explicit template argument lists may not be specified when calling any of them.
     * None of them is visible to argument-dependent lookup.
     * When one of them is found by normal unqualified lookup for the name to the left
       of the function-call operator, it inhibits argument-dependent lookup.

   In practice, they may be implemented as function objects, or with special compiler
   extensions.

.SH Parameters

   p - a pointer to the object to be destroyed

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Possible implementation

   struct destroy_at_fn {
     template<std::destructible T>
     constexpr void operator()(T *p) const noexcept
     {
       if constexpr (std::is_array_v<T>)
         for (auto &elem : *p)
           operator()(std::addressof(elem));
       else
         p->~T();
     }
   };

   inline constexpr destroy_at_fn destroy_at{};

.SH Notes

   destroy_at deduces the type of object to be destroyed and hence avoids writing it
   explicitly in the destructor call.

   When destroy_at is called in the evaluation of some constant expression e, the
   argument p must point to an object whose lifetime began within the evaluation of e.

.SH Example

   The following example demonstrates how to use ranges::destroy_at to destroy a
   contiguous sequence of elements.


// Run this code

 #include <memory>
 #include <new>
 #include <iostream>

 struct Tracer {
     int value;
     ~Tracer() { std::cout << value << " destructed\\n"; }
 };

 int main()
 {
     alignas(Tracer) unsigned char buffer[sizeof(Tracer) * 8];

     for (int i = 0; i < 8; ++i)
         new(buffer + sizeof(Tracer) * i) Tracer{i}; //manually construct objects

     auto ptr = std::launder(reinterpret_cast<Tracer*>(buffer));

     for (int i = 0; i < 8; ++i)
         std::ranges::destroy_at(ptr + i);
 }

.SH Output:

 0 destructed
 1 destructed
 2 destructed
 3 destructed
 4 destructed
 5 destructed
 6 destructed
 7 destructed
