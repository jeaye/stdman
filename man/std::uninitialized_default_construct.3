.SH NAME
std::uninitialized_default_construct \- std::uninitialized_default_construct

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <memory>
   template< class ForwardIt >
   void uninitialized_default_construct( ForwardIt first, ForwardIt   \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   last);
   template< class ExecutionPolicy, class ForwardIt >
   void uninitialized_default_construct( ExecutionPolicy&& policy,    \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   ForwardIt first, ForwardIt last );

   1) Constructs objects of type typename iterator_traits<ForwardIt>::value_type in the
   uninitialized storage designated by the range [first, last) by
   default-initialization, as if by

 for (; first != last; ++first)
   ::new (static_cast<void*>(std::addressof(*first)))
       typename iterator_traits<ForwardIt>::value_type;

   If an exception is thrown during the initialization, the function has no effects.
   2) Same as \fB(1)\fP, but executed according to policy. This overload does not participate
   in overload resolution unless
   std::is_execution_policy_v<std::decay_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true

.SH Parameters

   first, last         -         the range of the elements to initialize
   policy              -         the execution policy to use. See execution policy for
                                 details.
.SH Type requirements
   -
   ForwardIt must meet the requirements of ForwardIterator.
   -
   No increment, assignment, comparison, or indirection through valid instances of
   ForwardIt may throw exceptions.

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Complexity

   Linear in the distance between first and last

.SH Exceptions

   The overload with a template parameter named ExecutionPolicy reports errors as
   follows:

     * If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws an exception
       and ExecutionPolicy is one of the three standard policies, std::terminate is
       called. For any other ExecutionPolicy, the behavior is implementation-defined.
     * If the algorithm fails to allocate memory, std::bad_alloc is thrown.

.SH Possible implementation

   template<class ForwardIt>
   void uninitialized_default_construct(ForwardIt first, ForwardIt last)
   {
       typedef typename std::iterator_traits<ForwardIt>::value_type Value;
       ForwardIt current = first;
       try {
           for (; current != last; ++current) {
               ::new (static_cast<void*>(std::addressof(*current))) Value;
           }
       }  catch (...) {
           for (; first != current; ++first) {
               first->~Value();
           }
           throw;
       }
   }
