.SH NAME
std::filesystem::directory_entry::refresh \- std::filesystem::directory_entry::refresh

.SH Synopsis
   void refresh();                                \fI(since C++17)\fP
   void refresh( std::error_code& ec ) noexcept;

   Examines the filesystem object referred to by this directory entry and stores its
   attributes for retrieval with status(), exists(), is_regular_file(), and other
   status accessors.

   If an error occurs, the value of any cached attributes is unspecified

.SH Parameters

   ec - out-parameter for error reporting in the non-throwing overload

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Exceptions

   The overload that does not take a std::error_code& parameter throws filesystem_error
   on underlying OS API errors, constructed with p as the first path argument and the
   OS error code as the error code argument. The overload taking a std::error_code&
   parameter sets it to the OS API error code if an OS API call fails, and executes
   ec.clear() if no errors occur. Any overload not marked noexcept may throw
   std::bad_alloc if memory allocation fails.

.SH Notes

   Many low-level OS APIs for directory traversal retrieve file attributes along with
   the next directory entry. The constructors and the non-const member functions of
   directory_iterator store these attributes, if any, in the pointed-to directory_entry
   without calling directory_entry::refresh, which makes it possible to examine the
   attributes of the directory entries as they are being iterated over, without making
   additional system calls.
