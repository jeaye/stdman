.SH NAME
std::basic_stringbuf::underflow \- std::basic_stringbuf::underflow

.SH Synopsis
   protected:
   virtual int_type underflow()

   Reads the next character from the get area of the buffer.

   Specifically:

   1) If the input sequence has a read position available (egptr() > gptr()), returns
   Traits::to_int_type(*gptr())
   2) Otherwise, if pptr() > egptr() (some characters were inserted into the stream
   since the last time overflow() changed egptr()) then extends the end of the get area
   to include the most recently inserted characters, by changing egptr() to equal
   pptr(), and then returns Traits::to_int_type(*gptr())
   3) Otherwise, returns Traits::eof().

   Any character in the buffer which has been initialized, regardless of whether it
   originated from the string passed in the constructor or was appended by overflow(),
   is considered to be part of the input sequence.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   Traits::to_int_type(*gptr()) (the next character to read in the get area) in case of
   success, or Traits::eof() in case of failure.

                         // first three calls store "123" in the existing buffer
                         // 4th call finds that pptr() == epptr() and calls overflow()
                         // overflow() grows the buffer and sets egptr() to 4
                         // 5th and 6th calls store '5' and '6', advancing pptr()
     stream >> n; // calls sgetc() 4 times
                  // 1st call returns the '4' that was made available by overflow()
                  // on the 2nd call, egptr() == egptr() and underflow() is called
                  // underflow advances egptr() to equal pptr() (which is 6)
                  // 3rd sgetc() returns '6'
                  // 4th sgetc() finds gptr() == egptr(), calls underflow()
                  // underflow() returns EOF
     std::cout << n << '\\n';

 After overflow(): get area size is 4  put area size is 35
 Before underflow(): get area size is 4  put area size is 35
 After underflow(): get area size is 6  put area size is 35
 underflow() returns '5'
 Before underflow(): get area size is 6  put area size is 35
 After underflow(): get area size is 6  put area size is 35
 underflow() returns EOF
