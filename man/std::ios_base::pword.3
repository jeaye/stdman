.SH NAME
std::ios_base::pword \- std::ios_base::pword

.SH Synopsis
   void*& pword( int index );

   First, allocates or resizes the private storage (dynamic array of void* or another
   indexable data structure) sufficiently to make index a valid index, then returns a
   reference to the void* element of the private storage with the index index.

   The reference may be invalidated by any operation on this ios_base object, including
   another call to pword(), but the stored values are retained, so that reading from
   pword(index) with the same index later will produce the same value until the next
   call to std::basic_ios::copyfmt(). The value can be used for any purpose. The index
   of the element must be obtained by xalloc(), otherwise the behavior is undefined.
   New elements are initialized to a null pointer.

   If the function fails (possibly caused by an allocation failure) and *this is a base
   class subobject of a basic_ios<> object or subobject, calls
   std::basic_ios<>::setstate(badbit) which may throw std::ios_base::failure.

.SH Parameters

   index - index value of the element

.SH Return value

   A reference to the element.

.SH Exceptions

   May throw std::ios_base::failure when setting the badbit.

.SH Notes

   If the pointers stored in pword require management, register_callback() may be used
   to install handlers that execute deep copy or deallocation as needed.

.SH Example



   Uses base class pword storage for runtime type identification of derived stream
   objects.


// Run this code

 #include <iostream>

 template<class CharT, class Traits = std::char_traits<CharT>>
 class mystream : public std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>
 {
 public:
     static const int xindex;

     mystream(std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& ostr) :
         std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>(ostr.rdbuf())
     {
         this->pword(xindex) = this;
     }

     void myfn()
     {
         *this << "[special handling for mystream]";
     }
 };

 // Each specialization of mystream obtains a unique index from xalloc()
 template<class CharT, class Traits>
 const int mystream<CharT, Traits>::xindex = std::ios_base::xalloc();

 // This I/O manipulator will be able to recognize ostreams that are mystreams
 // by looking up the pointer stored in pword
 template<class CharT, class Traits>
 std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& mymanip(std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& os)
 {
     if (os.pword(mystream<CharT, Traits>::xindex) == &os)
         static_cast<mystream<CharT, Traits>&>(os).myfn();
     return os;
 }

 int main()
 {
     std::cout << "cout, narrow-character test " << mymanip << '\\n';

     mystream<char> myout(std::cout);
     myout << "myout, narrow-character test " << mymanip << '\\n';

     std::wcout << "wcout, wide-character test " << mymanip << '\\n';

     mystream<wchar_t> mywout(std::wcout);
     mywout << "mywout, wide-character test " << mymanip << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 cout, narrow-character test
 myout, narrow-character test [special handling for mystream]
 wcout, wide-character test
 mywout, wide-character test [special handling for mystream]
