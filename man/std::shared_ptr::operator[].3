.TH std::shared_ptr::operator[] 3 "2018.03.28" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::shared_ptr::operator[] \- std::shared_ptr::operator[]

.SH Synopsis
   element_type& operator[]( std::ptrdiff_t idx )  \fI(since C++17)\fP

   Index into the array pointed to by the stored pointer.

   The behavior is undefined if the stored pointer is null or if idx is negative.

   If T (the template parameter of shared_ptr) is an array type U[N], idx must be less
   than N, otherwise the behavior is undefined.

.SH Parameters

   idx - the array index

.SH Return value

   A reference to the idx-th element of the array , i.e., get()[i]

.SH Exceptions

   \fI(none)\fP

  Remarks

   When T is not an array type, it is unspecified whether this function is declared. If
   the function is declared, it is unspecified what its return type is, except that the
   declaration (although not necessarily the definition) of the function is guaranteed
   to be legal.
