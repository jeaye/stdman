.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstdlib>
   [[noreturn]] void quick_exit( int exit_code );  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Causes normal program termination to occur without completely cleaning the
   resources.

   Functions passed to std::at_quick_exit are called in reverse order of their
   registration. If an exception tries to propagate out of any of the functions,
   std::terminate is called. After calling the registered functions, calls
   std::_Exit(exit_code)

.SH Parameters

   exit_code - exit status of the program

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP
