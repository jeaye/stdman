.SH NAME
std::filesystem::directory_entry::status,std::filesystem::directory_entry::symlink_status \- std::filesystem::directory_entry::status,std::filesystem::directory_entry::symlink_status

.SH Synopsis
   std::filesystem::file_status status() const;
   std::filesystem::file_status status( std::error_code& ec ) const   \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   noexcept;
   std::filesystem::file_status symlink_status() const;
   std::filesystem::file_status symlink_status( std::error_code& ec ) \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   const noexcept;

   1) Returns status of the entry, as if determined by a status call (symlinks are
   followed to their targets)
   2) Returns status of the entry, as if determined by a symlink_status call (symlinks
   are not followed)

.SH Parameters

   ec - out-parameter for error reporting in the non-throwing overload

.SH Return value

   The status of the file referred to by the entry.

.SH Exceptions

   The overload that does not take a std::error_code& parameter throws filesystem_error
   on underlying OS API errors, constructed with p as the first path argument and the
   OS error code as the error code argument. The overload taking a std::error_code&
   parameter sets it to the OS API error code if an OS API call fails, and executes
   ec.clear() if no errors occur. Any overload not marked noexcept may throw
   std::bad_alloc if memory allocation fails.

.SH Notes

   Many low-level OS APIs for directory traversal retrieve file attributes along with
   the next directory entry. The constructors and the non-const member functions of
   directory_iterator store these attributes, if any, in the pointed-to directory_entry
   without calling directory_entry::refresh, which makes it possible to examine the
   attributes of the directory entries as they are being iterated over, without making
   additional system calls.

 "sandbox/symlink" is a symlink
 "dev/null" is a character device
 "dev/sda" is a block device
 "sandbox/no" does not exist
