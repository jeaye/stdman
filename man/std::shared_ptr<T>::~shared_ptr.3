.SH NAME
std::shared_ptr<T>::~shared_ptr \- std::shared_ptr<T>::~shared_ptr

.SH Synopsis
   ~shared_ptr();

   If *this owns an object and it is the last shared_ptr owning it, the object is
   destroyed through the owned deleter.

   After the destruction, the smart pointers that shared ownership with *this, if any,
   will report a use_count() that is one less than its previous value.

.SH Notes

   Unlike std::unique_ptr, the deleter of std::shared_ptr is invoked even if the
   managed pointer is null.
