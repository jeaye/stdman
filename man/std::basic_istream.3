.SH NAME
std::basic_istream \- std::basic_istream

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <istream>
   template<

       class CharT,
       class Traits = std::char_traits<CharT>

   > class basic_istream : virtual public std::basic_ios<CharT, Traits>

   The class template basic_istream provides support for high level input operations on
   character streams. The supported operations include formatted input (e.g. integer
   values or whitespace-separated characters and characters strings) and unformatted
   input (e.g. raw characters and character arrays). This functionality is implemented
   in terms of the interface provided by the underlying basic_streambuf class, accessed
   through the basic_ios base class. The only non-inherited data member of
   basic_istream, in most implementations, is the value returned by
   basic_istream::gcount().
