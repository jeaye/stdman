.SH NAME
std::atomic_signal_fence \- std::atomic_signal_fence

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <atomic>
   extern "C" void atomic_signal_fence( std::memory_order order )         \fI(since C++11)\fP
   noexcept;

   Establishes memory synchronization ordering of non-atomic and relaxed atomic
   accesses, as instructed by order, between a thread and a signal handler executed on
   the same thread. This is equivalent to std::atomic_thread_fence, except no CPU
   instructions for memory ordering are issued. Only reordering of the instructions by
   the compiler is suppressed as order instructs. For example, a fence with release
   semantics prevents reads or writes from being moved past subsequent writes and a
   fence with acquire semantics prevents reads or writes from being moved ahead of
   preceding reads.

.SH Parameters

   order - the memory ordering executed by this fence

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP
