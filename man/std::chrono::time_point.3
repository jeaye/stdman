.SH NAME
std::chrono::time_point \- std::chrono::time_point

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <chrono>
   template<

   class Clock,                               \fI(since C++11)\fP
   class Duration = typename Clock::duration

   > class time_point;

   Class template std::chrono::time_point represents a point in time. It is implemented
   as if it stores a value of type Duration indicating the time interval from the start
   of the Clock's epoch.

.SH Member types

   Member type Definition
   clock       Clock, the clock on which this time point is measured
   duration    Duration, a std::chrono::duration type used to measure the time since
               epoch
   rep         Rep, an arithmetic type representing the number of ticks of the duration
   period      Period, a std::ratio type representing the tick period of the duration

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <iomanip>
 #include <ctime>
 #include <chrono>

 int main()
 {
     std::chrono::system_clock::time_point now = std::chrono::system_clock::now();
     std::time_t now_c = std::chrono::system_clock::to_time_t(now - std::chrono::hours(24));
     std::cout << "24 hours ago, the time was "
               << std::put_time(std::localtime(&now_c), "%F %T") << '\\n';

     std::chrono::steady_clock::time_point start = std::chrono::steady_clock::now();
     std::cout << "Hello World\\n";
     std::chrono::steady_clock::time_point end = std::chrono::steady_clock::now();
     std::cout << "Printing took "
               << std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end - start).count()
               << "us.\\n";
 }

.SH Possible output:

 24 hours ago, the time was 2011-10-25 12:00:08
 Hello World
 Printing took 84us.
