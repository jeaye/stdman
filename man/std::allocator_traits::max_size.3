std::allocator_traits::max_size \- std::allocator_traits::max_size

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <memory>
   static size_type max_size( const Alloc& a ) noexcept;            \fI(since C++11)\fP
                                                                    \fI(until C++20)\fP
   static constexpr size_type max_size( const Alloc& a ) noexcept;  \fI(since C++20)\fP

   If possible, obtains the maximum theoretically possible allocation size from the
   allocator a, by calling a.max_size().

   If the above is not possible (e.g. Alloc does not have the member function
   max_size()), then returns std::numeric_limits<size_type>::max() /
   sizeof(value_type).

.SH Parameters

   a - allocator to detect

.SH Return value

   Theoretical maximum allocation size.

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to
   previously published C++ standards.
