.SH Synopsis
   future() noexcept;                      \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   future( future&& other ) noexcept;      \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Constructs a std::future object.

   1) Default constructor. Constructs a std::future with no shared state. After
   construction, valid() == false.
   2) Move constructor. Constructs a std::future with the shared state of other using
   move semantics. After construction, other.valid() == false.
   3) std::future is not CopyConstructible.

.SH Parameters

   other - another std::future to acquire shared state from
