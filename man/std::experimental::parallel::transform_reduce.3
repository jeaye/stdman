.SH NAME
std::experimental::parallel::transform_reduce \- std::experimental::parallel::transform_reduce

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/numeric>
   template<class InputIt, class UnaryOp, class T, class BinaryOp>

   T transform_reduce(InputIt first, InputIt last,                 \fB(1)\fP (parallelism TS)

                      UnaryOp unary_op, T init, BinaryOp
   binary_op);
   template<class ExecutionPolicy,

            class InputIt, class UnaryOp, class T, class BinaryOp>
   T transform_reduce(ExecutionPolicy&& policy,                    \fB(2)\fP (parallelism TS)
                      InputIt first, InputIt last,

                      UnaryOp unary_op, T init, BinaryOp
   binary_op);

   Applies unary_op to each element in the range [first; last) and reduces the results
   (possibly permuted and aggregated in unspecified manner) along with the initial
   value init over binary_op.

   The behavior is non-deterministic if binary_op is not associative or not
   commutative.

   The behavior is undefined if unary_op or binary_op modifies any element or
   invalidates any iterator in [first; last).

.SH Parameters

   first, last - the range of elements to apply the algorithm to
   init        - the initial value of the generalized sum
   policy      - the execution policy
   unary_op    - unary FunctionObject that will be applied to each element of the input
                 range. The return type must be acceptable as input to binary_op
   binary_op   - binary FunctionObject that will be applied in unspecified order to the
                 results of unary_op, the results of other binary_op and init.
.SH Type requirements
   -
   InputIt must meet the requirements of InputIterator.

.SH Return value

   Generalized sum of init and unary_op(*first), unary_op(*(first+1)), ...
   unary_op(*(last-1)) over binary_op,

   where generalized sum GSUM(op, a
   1, ..., a
   N) is defined as follows:

     * if N=1, a
       1
     * if N > 1, op(GSUM(op, b
       1, ..., b
       K), GSUM(op, b
       M, ..., b
       N)) where

              * b
                1, ..., b
                N may be any permutation of a1, ..., aN and
              * 1 < K+1 = M â‰¤ N

   in other words, the results of unary_op may be grouped and arranged in arbitrary
   order.

.SH Complexity

   O(last - first) applications each of unary_op and binary_op.

.SH Exceptions

     * If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws an exception,

              * if policy is parallel_vector_execution_policy, std::terminate is called
              * if policy is sequential_execution_policy or parallel_execution_policy,
                the algorithm exits with an exception_list containing all uncaught
                exceptions. If there was only one uncaught exception, the algorithm may
                rethrow it without wrapping in exception_list. It is unspecified how
                much work the algorithm will perform before returning after the first
                exception was encountered.
              * if policy is some other type, the behavior is implementation-defined

     * If the algorithm fails to allocate memory (either for itself or to construct an
       exception_list when handling a user exception), std::bad_alloc is thrown.

.SH Notes

   unary_op is not applied to init

   If the range is empty, init is returned, unmodified

     * If policy is an instance of sequential_execution_policy, all operations are
       performed in the calling thread.
     * If policy is an instance of parallel_execution_policy, operations may be
       performed in unspecified number of threads, indeterminately sequenced with each
       other
     * If policy is an instance of parallel_vector_execution_policy, execution may be
       both parallelized and vectorized: function body boundaries are not respected and
       user code may be overlapped and combined in arbitrary manner (in particular,
       this implies that a user-provided Callable must not acquire a mutex to access a
       shared resource)

.SH Example

   transform_reduce can be used to parallelize std::inner_product:

   
// Run this code

 #include <vector>
 #include <iterator>
 #include <functional>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <experimental/numeric>
 #include <experimental/execution_policy>
 #include <boost/iterator/zip_iterator.hpp>
 #include <boost/tuple.hpp>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::vector<double> xvalues(10007, 1.0), yvalues(10007, 1.0);
  
     double result = std::experimental::parallel::transform_reduce(
         std::experimental::parallel::par,
         boost::iterators::make_zip_iterator(
             boost::make_tuple(std::begin(xvalues), std::begin(yvalues))),
         boost::iterators::make_zip_iterator(
             boost::make_tuple(std::end(xvalues), std::end(yvalues))),
         [](auto r) { return boost::get<0>(r) * boost::get<1>(r); }
         0.0,
         std::plus<>()
     );
     std::cout << result << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 10007
