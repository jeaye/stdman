.SH NAME
std::sqrt(std::complex) \- std::sqrt(std::complex)

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <complex>
   template< class T >
   complex<T> sqrt( const complex<T>& z );

   Computes the square root of the complex number z with a branch cut along the
   negative real axis.

.SH Parameters

   z - complex number to take the square root of

.SH Return value

   If no errors occur, returns the square root of z, in the range of the right
   half-plane, including the imaginary axis ([0; +∞) along the real axis and (−∞; +∞)
   along the imaginary axis.)

   If the argument is a negative real number, the result lies on the positive imaginary
   axis.

   Error handling and special values

   Errors are reported consistent with math_errhandling

   If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic,

     * The function is continuous onto the branch cut taking into account the sign of
       imaginary part
     * std::sqrt(std::conj(z)) == std::conj(std::sqrt(z))
     * If z is (±0,+0), the result is (+0,+0)
     * If z is (x,+∞), the result is (+∞,+∞) even if x is NaN
     * If z is (x,NaN), the result is (NaN,NaN) (unless x is ±∞) and FE_INVALID may be
       raised
     * If z is (-∞,y), the result is (+0,+∞) for finite positive y
     * If z is (+∞,y), the result is (+∞,+0) for finite positive y
     * If z is (-∞,NaN), the result is (NaN,∞) (sign of imaginary part unspecified)
     * If z is (+∞,NaN), the result is (+∞,NaN)
     * If z is (NaN,y), the result is (NaN,NaN) and FE_INVALID may be raised
     * If z is (NaN,NaN), the result is (NaN,NaN)

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <complex>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::cout << "Square root of -4 is "
               << std::sqrt(std::complex<double>(-4, 0)) << '\\n'
               << "Square root of (-4,-0), the other side of the cut, is "
               << std::sqrt(std::complex<double>(-4, -0.0)) << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 Square root of -4 is (0,2)
 Square root of (-4,-0), the other side of the cut, is (0,-2)
