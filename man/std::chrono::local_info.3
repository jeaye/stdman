std::chrono::local_info \- std::chrono::local_info

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <chrono>
   struct local_info;          \fI(since C++20)\fP

   The class local_info describes the result of converting a std::chrono::local_time to
   a std::chrono::sys_time.

     * If the result of the conversion is unique, then result == local_info::unique,
       first is filled out with the correct std::chrono::sys_info, and second is
       zero-initialized.
     * If the local_time is nonexistent, then result == local_info::nonexistent, first
       is filled out with the std::chrono::sys_info that ends just prior to the
       local_time, and second is filled out with the std::chrono::sys_info that begins
       just after the local_time.
     * If the local_time is ambiguous, then result == local_info::ambiguous, first is
       filled out with the std::chrono::sys_info that ends just after the local_time,
       and second is filled with the std::chrono::sys_info that starts just before the
       local_time.

   This is a low-level data structure; typical conversions from local_time to sys_time
   will use it implicitly rather than explicitly.
