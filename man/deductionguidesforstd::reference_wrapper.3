deductionguidesforstd::reference_wrapper \- deductionguidesforstd::reference_wrapper

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <functional>
   template<typename T>                            (since C++20)
   reference_wrapper(T&) -> reference_wrapper<T>;

   One deduction guide is provided for std::reference_wrapper to support deduction of
   the sole class template parameter.

.SH Notes

   In C++17 this support is provided via the reference_wrapper(T&) constructor, but
   that constructor is removed in C++20 in favor of a constructor template that does
   not support class template argument deduction, necessitating a separate deduction
   guide.
