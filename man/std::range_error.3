.SH NAME
std::range_error \- std::range_error

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <stdexcept>
   class range_error;

   Defines a type of object to be thrown as exception. It can be used to report range
   errors (that is, situations where a result of a computation cannot be represented by
   the destination type).

   The only standard library components that throw this exception are
   std::wstring_convert::from_bytes and std::wstring_convert::to_bytes.

   The mathematical functions in the standard library components do not throw this
   exception (mathematical functions report range errors as specified in
   math_errhandling).

.SH Member functions

   constructor   constructs a new range_error object with the given message
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
   operator=     replaces the range_error object
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
   what          returns the explanatory string
                 \fI(public member function)\fP

std::range_error::range_error

   range_error( const std::string& what_arg );       \fB(1)\fP
   range_error( const char* what_arg );              \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   range_error( const range_error& other );          \fB(3)\fP               \fI(until C++11)\fP
   range_error( const range_error& other ) noexcept;                   \fI(since C++11)\fP

   1-2) Constructs the exception object with what_arg as explanatory string that can be
   accessed through what().
   3) Copy constructor.
   If *this and other both have dynamic type std::range_error then std::strcmp(what(),
   other.what()) == 0.
   \fI(since C++11)\fP

.SH Parameters

   what_arg - explanatory string
   other    - another exception object to copy

.SH Exceptions

   1-2) May throw std::bad_alloc

.SH Notes

   Because copying std::range_error is not permitted to throw exceptions, this message
   is typically stored internally as a separately-allocated reference-counted string.
   This is also why there is no constructor taking std::string&&: it would have to copy
   the content anyway.

std::range_error::operator=

   range_error& operator=( const range_error& other );           \fI(until C++11)\fP
   range_error& operator=( const range_error& other ) noexcept;  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Assigns the contents with those of other.
   If *this and other both have dynamic type std::range_error then std::strcmp(what(),
   other.what()) == 0 after assignment.
   \fI(since C++11)\fP

.SH Parameters

   other - another exception object to assign with

.SH Return value

   *this

std::range_error::what

   virtual const char* what() const throw();   \fI(until C++11)\fP
   virtual const char* what() const noexcept;  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Returns the explanatory string.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   Pointer to a null-terminated string with explanatory information. The string is
   suitable for conversion and display as a std::wstring. The pointer is guaranteed to
   be valid at least until the exception object from which it is obtained is destroyed,
   or until a non-const member function (e.g. copy assignment operator) on the
   exception object is called.

.SH Notes

   Implementations are allowed but not required to override what().
