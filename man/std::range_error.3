.TH std::range_error 3 "Sep  4 2015" "2.0 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <stdexcept>
   class range_error;

   Defines a type of object to be thrown as exception. It can be used to report range
   errors (that is, situations where a result of a computation cannot be represented by
   the destination type)

   The only standard library components that throw this exception are
   std::wstring_convert::from_bytes and std::wstring_convert::to_bytes.

   The mathematical functions in the standard library components do not throw this
   exception (mathematical functions report range errors as specified in
   math_errhandling).
