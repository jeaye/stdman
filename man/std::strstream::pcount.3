.SH NAME
std::strstream::pcount \- std::strstream::pcount

.SH Synopsis
   int pcount() const;

   Returns the number of characters that were output in the put area of the associated
   std::strstreambuf. Effectively calls rdbuf()->pcount()

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   The number of characters in the put area, or zero if nothing was output.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <strstream>
 #include <iostream>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::strstream dyn; // dynamically-allocated output buffer
     dyn << "Test: " << 1.23 << std::ends;
     std::cout << "The size of the output is " << dyn.pcount()
               << " and it holds \\"" << dyn.str() << "\\"\\n";
     dyn.freeze(false);
  
     char buf[10];
     std::strstream user(buf, 10); // user-provided output buffer
     user << 1.23; // note: no std::ends
     std::cout.write(buf, user.pcount());
     std::cout << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 The size of the output is 11 and it holds "Test: 1.23"
 1.23
