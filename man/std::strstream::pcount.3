 #include <strstream>
 #include <iostream>
  
 int main()
 {

     std::cout << "The size of the output is " << dyn.pcount()
               << " and it holds \\"" << dyn.str() << "\\"\\n";
     dyn.freeze(false);
  
     char buf[10];
     std::strstream user(buf, 10); // user-provided output buffer

     std::cout.write(buf, user.pcount());
