   Constructs a new directory iterator.

   1) Constructs the end iterator.
   2) Constructs a directory iterator that refers to the first directory entry of a
   directory identified by p. If p refers to an non-existing file or not a directory,
   throws std::filesystem::filesystem_error.
   3) Same as \fB(2)\fP, but if std::filesystem::directory_options::skip_permission_denied is
   set in options and construction encounters a permissions denied error, constructs
   the end iterator and does not report an error.
   4) Constructs a directory iterator that refers to the first directory entry of a
   directory identified by p. If p refers to an non-existing file or not a directory,
   returns the end iterator and sets ec.
   5) Same as \fB(4)\fP, but if std::filesystem::directory_options::skip_permission_denied is
   set in options and construction encounters a permissions denied error, constructs
   the end iterator and does not report an error.

.SH Exceptions

   2-5) The overload that does not take a std::error_code& parameter throws
   filesystem::filesystem_error on underlying OS API errors, constructed with p as the
   first path argument and the OS error code as the error code argument. The overload
   taking a std::error_code& parameter sets it to the OS API error code if an OS API
   call fails, and executes ec.clear() if no errors occur. Any overload not marked
   noexcept may throw std::bad_alloc if memory allocation fails.

.SH Notes

   To iterate over the current directory, construct the iterator as
   directory_iterator(".") instead of directory_iterator("").
