.SH NAME
std::undeclare_reachable \- std::undeclare_reachable

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <memory>
   template< class T >              \fI(since C++11)\fP
   T* undeclare_reachable( T* p );

   Removes the reachable status of the object, referenced by the pointer p, if it was
   previously set by std::declare_reachable. If the object was declared reachable
   multiple times, equal number of calls to undeclare_reachable would be needed to
   remove this status. Once the object is not declared reachable and has no pointers
   referencing it, it may be reclaimed by garbage collector or reported as a leak by a
   leak detector.

.SH Parameters

   p - a pointer to an object previously declared reachable and not destructed since
       then

.SH Return value

   A safely-derived copy of p.

.SH Exceptions

   None
