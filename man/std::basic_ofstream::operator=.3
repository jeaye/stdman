.SH NAME
std::basic_ofstream::operator= \- std::basic_ofstream::operator=

.SH Synopsis
   basic_ofstream& operator=( basic_ofstream&& other );  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Move assigns the file stream other to *this, effectively move-assigning both the
   std::basic_ostream base class and the associated std::basic_filebuf.

   other is left with no associated file. Note that the base class move assignment
   swaps all stream state variables (except for rdbuf) between *this and other.

.SH Parameters

   other - file stream to move.

.SH Return value

   *this
