.SH NAME
std::tuple_size \- std::tuple_size

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <utility>
   template <class T1, class T2>

   struct tuple_size<std::pair<T1, T2>>           \fI(since C++11)\fP

   : std::integral_constant<std::size_t, 2> { };

   The partial specialization of std::tuple_size for pairs provides a compile-time way
   to obtain the number of elements in a pair, which is always 2, using tuple-like
   syntax.

Inherited from std::integral_constant

.SH Member constants

   value    the constant value 2
   \fB[static]\fP \fI(public static member constant)\fP

.SH Member functions

   operator std::size_t converts the object to std::size_t, returns value
                        \fI(public member function)\fP
   operator()           returns value
   \fI(C++14)\fP              \fI(public member function)\fP

.SH Member types

   Type       Definition
   value_type std::size_t
   type       std::integral_constant<std::size_t, value>

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <utility>
 #include <tuple>

 template<class T>
 void test(T t)
 {
     int a[std::tuple_size<T>::value]; // can be used at compile time
     std::cout << std::tuple_size<T>::value << '\\n'; // or at run time
 }

 int main()
 {
     test(std::make_tuple(1, 2, 3.14));
     test(std::make_pair(1, 3.14));
 }

.SH Output:
