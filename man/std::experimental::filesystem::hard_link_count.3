.SH NAME
std::experimental::filesystem::hard_link_count \- std::experimental::filesystem::hard_link_count

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/filesystem>
   std::uintmax_t hard_link_count( const path& p );                 \fB(1)\fP (filesystem TS)
   std::uintmax_t hard_link_count( const path& p, error_code& ec );

   Returns the number of hard links for the filesystem object identified by path p.

   The non-throwing overload returns static_cast<uintmax_t>(-1) on errors.

.SH Parameters

   p  - path to examine
   ec - out-parameter for error reporting in the non-throwing overload

.SH Return value

   The number of hard links for p

.SH Exceptions

   The overload that does not take a error_code& parameter throws filesystem_error on
   underlying OS API errors, constructed with p as the first argument and the OS error
   code as the error code argument. std::bad_alloc may be thrown if memory allocation
   fails. The overload taking a error_code& parameter sets it to the OS API error code
   if an OS API call fails, and executes ec.clear() if no errors occur. This overload
   has
   noexcept specification:  
   noexcept
     

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <experimental/filesystem>
 namespace fs = std::experimental::filesystem;
 int main()
 {
     // On a POSIX-style filesystem, each directory has at least 2 hard links:
     // itself and the special member pathname "."
     fs::path p = fs::current_path();
     std::cout << "Number of hard links for current path is "
               << fs::hard_link_count(p) << '\\n';
  
     // each ".." is a hard link to the parent directory, so the total number
     // of hard links for any directory is 2 plus number of direct subdirectories
     p = fs::current_path() / ".."; // each dot-dot is a hard link to parent
     std::cout << "Number of hard links for .. is "
               << fs::hard_link_count(p) << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 Number of hard links for current path is 2
 Number of hard links for .. is 3
