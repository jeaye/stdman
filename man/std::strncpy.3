.TH std::strncpy 3 "Nov 16 2016" "2.1 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::strncpy \- std::strncpy

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstring>
   char *strncpy( char *dest, const char *src, std::size_t count );

   Copies at most count characters of the byte string pointed to by src (including the
   terminating null character) to character array pointed to by dest.

   If count is reached before the entire string src was copied, the resulting character
   array is not null-terminated.

   If, after copying the terminating null character from src, count is not reached,
   additional null characters are written to dest until the total of count characters
   have been written.

   If the strings overlap, the behavior is undefined.

.SH Parameters

   dest  - pointer to the character array to copy to
   src   - pointer to the byte string to copy from
   count - maximum number of characters to copy

.SH Return value

   dest

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <cstring>

 int main()
 {
     const char* src = "hi";
     char dest[6] = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'};
     std::strncpy(dest, src, 5);

     std::cout << "The contents of dest are: ";
     for (char c : dest) {
         if (c) {
             std::cout << c << ' ';
         } else {
             std::cout << "\\\\0" << ' ';
         }
     }
     std::cout << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 The contents of dest are: h i \\0 \\0 \\0 f
