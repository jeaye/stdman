.SH NAME
std::experimental::basic_string_view::data \- std::experimental::basic_string_view::data

.SH Synopsis
   constexpr const_pointer data() const noexcept;  (library fundamentals TS)

   Returns a pointer to the underlying character array. The pointer is such that the
   range [data(), data() + size()) is valid and the values in it correspond to the
   values of the view. (n.b. Unlike basic_string::data() and string literals, data()
   may return a pointer to a buffer that is not null-terminated. Therefore it is
   typically a mistake to pass data() to a routine that takes just a const CharT* and
   expects a null-terminated string.)

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   A pointer to the underlying character array.

.SH Complexity

   Constant.
