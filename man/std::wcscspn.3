.SH NAME
std::wcscspn \- std::wcscspn

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cwchar>
   std::size_t wcscspn( const wchar_t* dest, const wchar_t* src );

   Returns the length of the maximum initial segment of the wide string pointed to by
   dest, that consists of only the characters not found in wide string pointed to by
   src.

.SH Parameters

   dest - pointer to the null-terminated wide string to be analyzed
   src  - pointer to the null-terminated wide string that contains the characters to
          search for

.SH Return value

   The length of the maximum initial segment that contains only characters not found in
   the character string pointed to by src

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <cwchar>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <locale>

 int main()
 {
     wchar_t dest[] = L"白猫 黑狗 甲虫";
     //                      └───┐
     const wchar_t *src = L"甲虫,黑狗";

     const std::size_t len = std::wcscspn(dest, src);
     dest[len] = L'\\0'; // terminates the segment to print it out

     std::wcout.imbue(std::locale("en_US.utf8"));
     std::wcout << L"The length of maximum initial segment is " << len << L".\\n";
     std::wcout << L"The segment is \\"" << dest << L"\\".\\n";
 }

.SH Possible output:

 The length of maximum initial segment is 3.
 The segment is "白猫 ".
