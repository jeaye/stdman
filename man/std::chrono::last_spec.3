   last_spec is an empty tag type that is used in conjunction with other calendar types
   to indicate the last thing in a sequence. Depending on context, it may indicate the
   last day of a month (as in 2018y/February/last, for last day of February 2018, i.e.,
   2018-02-28) or the last day of the week in a month (as in
   2018/February/Sunday[last], for last Sunday of February 2018, i.e., 2018-02-25).
