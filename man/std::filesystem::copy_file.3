.SH NAME
std::filesystem::copy_file \- std::filesystem::copy_file

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <filesystem>
   bool copy_file( const std::filesystem::path& from,

   const std::filesystem::path& to );
   bool copy_file( const std::filesystem::path& from, \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   const std::filesystem::path& to,

   std::error_code& ec );
   bool copy_file( const std::filesystem::path& from,

   const std::filesystem::path& to,
   std::filesystem::copy_options options );
   bool copy_file( const std::filesystem::path& from, \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   const std::filesystem::path& to,
   std::filesystem::copy_options options,

   std::error_code& ec );

   1) The default, equivalent to \fB(2)\fP with copy_options::none used as options
   2) Copies a single file from from to to, using the copy options indicated by
   options. The behavior is undefined if there is more than one option in any of the
   copy_options option group present in options (even in the groups not relevant to
   copy_file)

     * If !is_regular_file(from) (either because the source file doesn't exist or
       because it is not a regular file), report an error
     * Otherwise, if the destination file does not exist,

              * copies the contents and the attributes of the file to which from
                resolves to the file to which to resolves (symlinks are followed)

     * Otherwise, if the destination file already exists...

              * Report an error if any of the following is true:

                           * to and from are the same as determined by equivalent(from,
                             to);
                           * if to is not a regular file as determined by
                             !is_regular_file(to)
                           * if none of the {{tt|copy_file{{control options are set in
                             options

              * Otherwise, if copy_options::skip_existing is set in options, do nothing
              * Otherwise, if copy_options::overwrite_existing is set in options, copy
                the contents and the attributes of the file to which from resolves to
                the file to which to resolves
              * Otherwise, if copy_options::update_existing is set in options, only
                copy the file if from is newer than to, as defined by last_write_time()

   The non-throwing overloads return false if an error occurs.

.SH Parameters

   from - path to the source file
   to   - path to the target file
   ec   - out-parameter for error reporting in the non-throwing overload

.SH Return value

   true if the file was copied, false otherwise.

.SH Exceptions

   The overload that does not take a std::error_code& parameter throws filesystem_error
   on underlying OS API errors, constructed with from as the first argument, to as the
   second argument, and the OS error code as the error code argument. std::bad_alloc
   may be thrown if memory allocation fails. The overload taking a std::error_code&
   parameter sets it to the OS API error code if an OS API call fails, and executes
   ec.clear() if no errors occur. This overload has
   noexcept specification:
   noexcept

.SH Notes

   The functions involve at most one direct or indirect call to status(to) (used both
   to determine if the file exists, and, for copy_options::update_existing option, its
   last write time)

   Error is reported when copy_file is used to copy a directory: use copy for that.

   copy_file follows symlinks: use copy_symlink or copy with
   copy_options::copy_symlinks for that.

.SH Examples

   
// Run this code

 #include <fstream>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <filesystem>
 namespace fs = std::filesystem;

 int main()
 {
     fs::create_directory("sandbox");
     std::ofstream("sandbox/file1.txt").put('a');

     fs::copy_file("sandbox/file1.txt", "sandbox/file2.txt");

     // now there are two files in sandbox:
     std::cout << "file1.txt holds : "
               << std::ifstream("sandbox/file1.txt").rdbuf() << '\\n';
     std::cout << "file2.txt holds : "
               << std::ifstream("sandbox/file2.txt").rdbuf() << '\\n';

     // fail to copy directory
     fs::create_directory("sandbox/abc");
     try {
         fs::copy_file("sandbox/abc", "sandbox/def");
     } catch(fs::filesystem_error& e) {
         std::cout << "Could not copy sandbox/abc: " << e.what() << '\\n';
     }
     fs::remove_all("sandbox");
 }

.SH Possible output:

 file1.txt holds : a
 file2.txt holds : a
 Could not copy sandbox/abc: copy_file: Is a directory: "sandbox/abc", "sandbox/def"
