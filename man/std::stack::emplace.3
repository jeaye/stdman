.SH NAME
std::stack::emplace \- std::stack::emplace

.SH Synopsis
   template< class... Args >        \fI(since C++11)\fP
   void emplace( Args&&... args );

   Pushes new element on top of the stack. The element is constructed in-place, i.e. no
   copy or move operations are performed. The constructor of the element is called with
   exactly the same arguments as supplied to the function.

   Effectively calls c.emplace_back(std::forward<Args>(args)...)

.SH Parameters

   args - arguments to forward to the constructor of the element

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Complexity

   Identical to the complexity of Container::emplace_back.
