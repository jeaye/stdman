.SH NAME
std::allocator_traits::destroy \- std::allocator_traits::destroy

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <memory>
   template< class T >                     \fI(since C++11)\fP
   static void destroy( Alloc& a, T* p );

   Calls the destructor of the object pointed to by p. If possible, does so by calling
   a.destroy(p). If not possible (e.g. a does not have the member function destroy()),
   then calls the destructor of *p directly, as p->~T().

.SH Parameters

   a - allocator to use for destruction
   p - pointer to the object being destroyed

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Notes

   Because this function provides the automatic fall back to direct call to the
   destructor, the member function destroy() is an optional Allocator requirement since
   C++11.
