.SH NAME
std::basic_streambuf::underflow \- std::basic_streambuf::underflow

.SH Synopsis
   virtual int_type underflow();

   Ensures that at least one character is available in the input area by updating the
   pointers to the input area (if needed) and reading more data in from the input
   sequence (if applicable). Returns the value of that character (converted to int_type
   with Traits::to_int_type(c)) on success or Traits::eof() on failure.

   The function may update gptr, egptr and eback pointers to define the location of
   newly loaded data (if any). On failure, the function ensures that either gptr() ==
   nullptr or gptr() == egptr.

   The base class version of the function does nothing. The derived classes may
   override this function to allow updates to the get area in the case of exhaustion.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   The value of the character pointed to by the get pointer after the call on success,
   or Traits::eof() otherwise.

   The base class version of the function returns traits::eof().

.SH Note

   The public functions of std::streambuf call this function only if gptr() == nullptr
   or gptr() >= egptr().

.SH Example

   
   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <sstream>
  
 class null_filter_buf : public std::streambuf {
     std::streambuf* src;
     char ch; // single-byte buffer
 protected:
     int underflow() {
         while( (ch= src->sbumpc()) == '\\0') ; // skip zeroes
         setg(&ch, &ch, &ch+1); // make one read position available
         return ch; // may return EOF
     }
 public:
     null_filter_buf(std::streambuf* buf) : src(buf) {
         setg(&ch, &ch+1, &ch+1); // buffer is initially full
     }
 };
  
 void filtered_read(std::istream& in)
 {
     std::streambuf* orig = in.rdbuf();
     null_filter_buf buf(orig);
     in.rdbuf(&buf);
     for(char c; in.get(c); )
             std::cout << c;
     in.rdbuf(orig);
 }
  
 int main()
 {
     char a[] = "This i\\0s \\0an e\\0\\0\\0xample";
     std::istringstream in(std::string(std::begin(a), std::end(a)));
     filtered_read(in);
 }
