.SH NAME
std::scoped_lock::scoped_lock \- std::scoped_lock::scoped_lock

.SH Synopsis
   explicit scoped_lock( MutexTypes&... m );           \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   scoped_lock( std::adopt_lock_t, MutexTypes&... m ); \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   scoped_lock( const scoped_lock& ) = delete;         \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP

   Acquires ownership of the given mutexes m.

   1) If sizeof...(MutexTypes) == 0, does nothing. Otherwise, If sizeof...(MutexTypes)
   == 1, effectively calls m.lock(). Otherwise, effectively calls std::lock(m...). The
   behavior is undefined if one of MutexTypes is not a recursive mutex and the current
   thread already owns the corresponding argument in m....
   2) Acquires ownership of the mutexes m... without attempting to lock any of them.
   The behavior is undefined unless the current thread owns all of the mutexes in m....
   3) Copy constructor is deleted.

   The behavior is undefined if m is destroyed before the scoped_lock object is.

.SH Parameters

   m - mutexes to acquire ownership of

.SH Exceptions

   1) Throws any exceptions thrown by m.lock()
   2) Throws nothing
