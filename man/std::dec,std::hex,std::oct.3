.TH std::dec,std::hex,std::oct 3 "2021.11.17" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::dec,std::hex,std::oct \- std::dec,std::hex,std::oct

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <ios>
   std::ios_base& dec( std::ios_base& str ); \fB(1)\fP
   std::ios_base& hex( std::ios_base& str ); \fB(2)\fP
   std::ios_base& oct( std::ios_base& str ); \fB(3)\fP

   Modifies the default numeric base for integer I/O.

   1) sets the basefield of the stream str to dec as if by calling
   str.setf(std::ios_base::dec, std::ios_base::basefield)

   2) sets the basefield of the stream str to hex as if by calling
   str.setf(std::ios_base::hex, std::ios_base::basefield)

   3) sets the basefield of the stream str to oct as if by calling
   str.setf(std::ios_base::oct, std::ios_base::basefield)

   This is an I/O manipulator. It may be called with an expression such as out <<
   std::hex for any out of type std::basic_ostream or with an expression such as in >>
   std::hex for any in of type std::basic_istream.

.SH Parameters

   str - reference to I/O stream

.SH Return value

   str (reference to the stream after manipulation)

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <sstream>
 int main()
 {
     std::cout << "The number 42 in octal:   " << std::oct << 42 << '\\n'
               << "The number 42 in decimal: " << std::dec << 42 << '\\n'
               << "The number 42 in hex:     " << std::hex << 42 << '\\n';
     int n;
     std::istringstream("2A") >> std::hex >> n;
     std::cout << std::dec << "Parsing \\"2A\\" as hex gives " << n << '\\n';
     // the output base is sticky until changed
     std::cout << std::hex << "42 as hex gives " << 42
         << " and 21 as hex gives " << 21 << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 The number 42 in octal:   52
 The number 42 in decimal: 42
 The number 42 in hex:     2a
 Parsing "2A" as hex gives 42
 42 as hex gives 2a and 21 as hex gives 15
