       class CharT,
       class Traits = std::char_traits<CharT>

   > class basic_filebuf : public std::basic_streambuf<CharT, Traits>

   std::basic_filebuf is a std::basic_streambuf whose associated character sequence is
   a file. Both the input sequence and the output sequence are associated with the same
   file, and a joint file position is maintained for both operations.

   The functions underflow() and overflow()/sync() perform the actual I/O between the
   file and the get and put areas of the buffer. When CharT is not char, most
   implementations store multibyte characters in the file and a std::codecvt facet is
   used to perform wide/multibyte character conversion.

   Two specializations for common character types are also defined:
