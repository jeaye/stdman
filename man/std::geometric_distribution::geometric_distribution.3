.SH NAME
std::geometric_distribution::geometric_distribution \- std::geometric_distribution::geometric_distribution

.SH Synopsis
   geometric_distribution() : geometric_distribution(0.5) {}    \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   explicit geometric_distribution( double p );                 \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   explicit geometric_distribution( const param_type& params ); \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Constructs a new distribution object.

   2) Uses p as the distribution parameter.
   3) Uses params as the distribution parameter.

.SH Parameters

   p      - the p distribution parameter (probability of a trial generating true)
   params - the distribution parameter set

.SH Notes

   Requires that 0 < p < 1.
