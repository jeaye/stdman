.TH std::fgets 3 "2019.03.28" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::fgets \- std::fgets

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstdio>
   char* fgets( char* str, int count, std::FILE* stream );

   Reads at most count - 1 characters from the given file stream and stores them in the
   character array pointed to by str. Reading stops if end-of-file occurs or a newline
   character is found, in which case str will contain that newline character. If no
   errors occur, writes a null character at the position immediately after the last
   character written to str.

.SH Parameters

   str    - pointer to an element of a char array
   count  - maximum number of characters to write (typically the length of str)
   stream - file stream to read the data from

.SH Return value

   str on success, null pointer on failure.

   If the failure has been caused by end-of-file condition, additionally sets the eof
   indicator (see std::feof()) on stream. The contents of the array pointed to by str
   are not altered in this case.

   If the failure has been caused by some other error, sets the error indicator (see
   std::ferror()) on stream. The contents of the array pointed to by str are
   indeterminate (it may not even be null-terminated).

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <cstdio>
 #include <cstdlib>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::FILE* tmpf = std::tmpfile();
     std::fputs("Alan Turing\\n", tmpf);
     std::fputs("John von Neumann\\n", tmpf);
     std::fputs("Alonzo Church\\n", tmpf);
  
     std::rewind(tmpf);
     char buf[8];
     while (std::fgets(buf, sizeof buf, tmpf) != NULL) {
         std::cout << '"' << buf << '"' << '\\n';
     }
 }

.SH Output:

 "Alan Tu"
 "ring
 "
 "John vo"
 "n Neuma"
 "nn
 "
 "Alonzo "
 "Church
 "
