.SH NAME
std::fputc,std::putc \- std::fputc,std::putc

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstdio>
   int fputc( int ch, std::FILE* stream );
   int putc( int ch, std::FILE* stream );

   Writes a character ch to the given output stream stream.

   Internally, the character is converted to unsigned char just before being written.

   In C, putc() may be implemented as a macro, which is disallowed in C++. Therefore
   calls to std::fputc() and std::putc() always have the same effect.

.SH Parameters

   ch     - character to be written
   stream - output stream

.SH Return value

   On success, returns the written character.

   On failure, returns EOF and sets the error indicator (see std::ferror()) on stream.

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <cstdio>

 int main()
 {
     for (char c = 'a'; c != 'z'; c++)
         std::putc(c, stdout);
     std::putc('\\n', stdout);

     // putchar return value is not equal to the argument
     int r = 0x1070;
     std::printf("\\n0x%x\\n", r);
     r = std::putchar(r);
     std::printf("\\n0x%x\\n", r);
 }

.SH Output:

 abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy
 0x1070
 p
 0x70
