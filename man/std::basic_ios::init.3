std::basic_ios::init \- std::basic_ios::init

.SH Synopsis
   protected:
   void init( std::basic_streambuf<CharT,Traits>* sb );

   Sets the associated stream buffer to sb and initializes the internal state.

   The postconditions are as follows:

     Element                        Value
   rdbuf()      sb
   tie()        NULL
   rdstate()    goodbit if sb is not NULL, otherwise badbit
   exceptions() goodbit
   flags()      skipws | dec
   width()      0
   precision()  6
   fill()       widen(' ')
   getloc()     a copy of the value returned by std::locale()

   This member function is protected: it is called by the constructors of the derived
   stream classes std::basic_istream and std::basic_ostream once the associated stream
   buffer is known. Until this function is called, every member function (other than
   the destructor) of the default-constructed std::basic_ios invokes undefined
   behavior. Note that basic_ios is a virtual base class, and therefore its constructor
   is not called by the constructors of those directly derived classes, which is why
   two-stage initialization is necessary.

.SH Parameters

   sb - stream buffer to associate to
