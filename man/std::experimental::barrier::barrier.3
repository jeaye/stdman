.SH NAME
std::experimental::barrier::barrier \- std::experimental::barrier::barrier

.SH Synopsis
   explicit barrier( std::ptrdiff_t num_threads ); \fB(1)\fP (concurrency TS)
   barrier( const barrier & ) = delete;            \fB(2)\fP (concurrency TS)

   1) Constructs a barrier for num_threads participating threads. The set of
   participating threads is the first num_threads threads to arrive at the
   synchronization point.
   2) Copy constructor is deleted; barrier is not copyable.

.SH Parameters

   num_threads - the number of participating threads for the barrier; must be
                 non-negative

.SH Notes

   If num_threads is zero, the set of participating threads is empty, and barrier can
   only be destroyed.
