.TH std::shared_mutex::try_lock_shared 3 "Sep  4 2015" "2.0 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   bool try_lock_shared();  (since C++17)

   Tries to lock the mutex in shared mode. Returns immediately. On successful lock
   acquisition returns true, otherwise returns false.

   This function is allowed to fail spuriously and return false even if the mutex is
   not currenly exclusively locked by any other thread.

   Prior unlock() operation on the same mutex synchronizes-with (as defined in
   std::memory_order) this operation if it returns true.

   The behavior is undefined if the calling thread already owns the mutex in any mode.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   true if the lock was acquired successfully, otherwise false.

.SH Exceptions
