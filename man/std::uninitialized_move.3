.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <memory>
   template< class InputIt, class NoThrowForwardIt >

   NoThrowForwardIt uninitialized_move( InputIt first, InputIt last,  \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP

                                        NoThrowForwardIt d_first );
   template< class ExecutionPolicy, class ForwardIt, class
   NoThrowForwardIt >

   NoThrowForwardIt uninitialized_move( ExecutionPolicy&& policy,     \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
                                        ForwardIt first, ForwardIt
   last,

                                        NoThrowForwardIt d_first );

   1) Moves elements from the range [first, last) to an uninitialized memory area
   beginning at d_first as if by
   for (; first != last; ++d_first, (void) ++first)
       ::new (static_cast<void*>(std::addressof(*d_first)))
           typename
   std::iterator_traits<NoThrowForwardIt>::value_type(std::move(*first));
   If an exception is thrown during the initialization, some objects in [first, last)
   are left in a valid but unspecified state, and the objects already constructed are
   destroyed in an unspecified order.

   If d_first + [0, std::distance(first, last)) overlaps with             \fI(since C++20)\fP
   [first, last), the behavior is undefined.

   2) Same as \fB(1)\fP, but executed according to policy. This overload participates in
   overload resolution only if

   std::is_execution_policy_v<std::decay_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true.        (until
                                                                             C++20)
   std::is_execution_policy_v<std::remove_cvref_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true. (since
                                                                             C++20)

.SH Parameters

   first, last           -        the range of the elements to move
   d_first               -        the beginning of the destination range
   policy                -        the execution policy to use. See execution policy for
                                  details.
.SH Type requirements
   -
   InputIt must meet the requirements of LegacyInputIterator.
   -
   ForwardIt must meet the requirements of LegacyForwardIterator.
   -
   NoThrowForwardIt must meet the requirements of LegacyForwardIterator.
   -
   No increment, assignment, comparison, or indirection through valid instances of
   NoThrowForwardIt may throw exceptions.

.SH Return value

   Iterator to the element past the last element moved.

.SH Complexity

   Linear in the distance between first and last.

.SH Exceptions

   The overload with a template parameter named ExecutionPolicy reports errors as
   follows:

     * If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws an exception
       and ExecutionPolicy is one of the standard policies, std::terminate is called.
       For any other ExecutionPolicy, the behavior is implementation-defined.
     * If the algorithm fails to allocate memory, std::bad_alloc is thrown.

.SH Possible implementation

template<class InputIt, class NoThrowForwardIt>
NoThrowForwardIt uninitialized_move(InputIt first, InputIt last, NoThrowForwardIt d_first)
{
    using Value = typename std::iterator_traits<NoThrowForwardIt>::value_type;
    NoThrowForwardIt current = d_first;
    try
    {
        for (; first != last; ++first, (void) ++current)
            ::new (static_cast<void*>(std::addressof(*current))) Value(std::move(*first));
        return current;
    }
    catch (...)
    {
        std::destroy(d_first, current);
        throw;
    }
}

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <cstdlib>
 #include <iomanip>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <memory>
 #include <string>

 void print(auto rem, auto first, auto last)
 {
     for (std::cout << rem; first != last; ++first)
         std::cout << std::quoted(*first) << ' ';
     std::cout << '\\n';
 }

 int main()
 {
     std::string in[]{"Home", "Work!"};
     print("initially, in: ", std::begin(in), std::end(in));

     if (
         constexpr auto sz = std::size(in);
         void* out = std::aligned_alloc(alignof(std::string), sizeof(std::string) * sz))
     {
         try
         {
             auto first{static_cast<std::string*>(out)};
             auto last{first + sz};
             std::uninitialized_move(std::begin(in), std::end(in), first);

             print("after move, in: ", std::begin(in), std::end(in));
             print("after move, out: ", first, last);

             std::destroy(first, last);
         }
         catch (...)
         {
             std::cout << "Exception!\\n";
         }
         std::free(out);
     }
 }

.SH Possible output:

 initially, in: "Home" "Work!"
 after move, in: "" ""
 after move, out: "Home" "Work!"
