.SH NAME
std::lock_guard \- std::lock_guard

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <mutex>
   template< class Mutex >
   class lock_guard;

   The class lock_guard is a mutex wrapper that provides a convenient RAII-style
   mechanism for owning a mutex for the duration of a scoped block.

   When a lock_guard object is created, it attempts to take ownership of the mutex it
   is given. When control leaves the scope in which the lock_guard object was created,
   the lock_guard is destructed and the mutex is released.

   The lock_guard class is non-copyable.

.SH Template parameters

   Mutex - the type of the mutex to lock. The type must meet the BasicLockable
           requirements

.SH Member types

   Member type Definition
   mutex_type  Mutex

.SH Member functions

   constructor   constructs a lock_guard, optionally locking the given mutex
                 \fI(public member function)\fP 
   destructor    destructs the lock_guard object, unlocks the underlying mutex
                 \fI(public member function)\fP 
   operator=     not copy-assignable
   [deleted]     \fI(public member function)\fP 

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <thread>
 #include <mutex>
 #include <iostream>
  
 int g_i = 0;
 std::mutex g_i_mutex;  // protects g_i
  
 void safe_increment()
 {
     std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(g_i_mutex);
     ++g_i;
  
     std::cout << std::this_thread::get_id() << ": " << g_i << '\\n';
  
     // g_i_mutex is automatically released when lock
     // goes out of scope
 }
  
 int main()
 {
     std::cout << __func__ << ": " << g_i << '\\n';
  
     std::thread t1(safe_increment);
     std::thread t2(safe_increment);
  
     t1.join();
     t2.join();
  
     std::cout << __func__ << ": " << g_i << '\\n';
 }
