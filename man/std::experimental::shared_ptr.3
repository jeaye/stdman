.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/memory>
   template< class T > class shared_ptr;    (library fundamentals TS)

   std::experimental::shared_ptr is a modified version of std::shared_ptr that adds
   support for arrays.

Members and non-members identical to std::shared_ptr

.SH Member functions

   The following member functions work with std::experimental::shared_ptr instead of
   std::shared_ptr and std::experimental::weak_ptr instead of std::weak_ptr. The
   behavior is otherwise identical.

   destructor    destructs the owned object if no more shared_ptrs link to it
                 \fI(public member function of std::shared_ptr)\fP
   operator=     assigns the shared_ptr
                 \fI(public member function of std::shared_ptr)\fP
.SH Modifiers
   reset         replaces the managed object
                 \fI(public member function of std::shared_ptr)\fP
   swap          swaps the managed objects
                 \fI(public member function of std::shared_ptr)\fP
.SH Observers
                 returns the number of shared_ptr objects referring to the same managed
   use_count     object
                 \fI(public member function of std::shared_ptr)\fP
   unique        checks whether the managed object is managed only by the current
   \fB(deprecated)\fP  shared_ptr instance
                 \fI(public member function of std::shared_ptr)\fP
   operator bool checks if the stored pointer is not null
                 \fI(public member function of std::shared_ptr)\fP
   owner_before  provides owner-based ordering of shared pointers
                 \fI(public member function of std::shared_ptr)\fP

.SH Non-member functions

   These non-member functions are declared in the std::experimental namespace, and work
   with std::experimental::shared_ptr rather than std::shared_ptr, but otherwise
   behaves identically to the corresponding C++14 function.

   make_shared                creates a shared pointer that manages a new object
                              \fI(function template)\fP
                              creates a shared pointer that manages a new object
   allocate_shared            allocated using an allocator
                              \fI(function template)\fP
   get_deleter                returns the deleter of specified type, if owned
                              \fI(function template)\fP
   operator==
   operator!=
   operator<                  compares with another shared_ptr or with nullptr
   operator<=                 \fI(function template)\fP
   operator>
   operator>=
                              outputs the value of the stored pointer to an output
   operator<<                 stream
                              \fI(function template)\fP
   std::swap(std::shared_ptr) specializes the std::swap algorithm
   \fI(C++11)\fP                    \fI(function template)\fP

   std::atomic_is_lock_free(std::shared_ptr)
   std::atomic_load(std::shared_ptr)
   std::atomic_load_explicit(std::shared_ptr)
   std::atomic_store(std::shared_ptr)                            specializes atomic
   std::atomic_store_explicit(std::shared_ptr)                   operations for
   std::atomic_exchange(std::shared_ptr)                         std::shared_ptr
   std::atomic_exchange_explicit(std::shared_ptr)                \fI(function template)\fP
   std::atomic_compare_exchange_weak(std::shared_ptr)
   std::atomic_compare_exchange_strong(std::shared_ptr)
   std::atomic_compare_exchange_weak_explicit(std::shared_ptr)
   std::atomic_compare_exchange_strong_explicit(std::shared_ptr)

  Helper class templates

   These class templates are declared in the std::experimental namespace, and work with
   std::experimental::shared_ptr and std::experimental::weak_ptr rather than
   std::shared_ptr and std::weak_ptr, but otherwise behaves identically to the
   corresponding C++14 class template.

   owner_less              provides mixed-type owner-based ordering of shared and weak
   \fI(C++11)\fP                 pointers
                           \fI(class template)\fP
   enable_shared_from_this allows an object to create a shared_ptr referring to itself
   \fI(C++11)\fP                 \fI(class template)\fP
