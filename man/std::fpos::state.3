.TH std::fpos::state 3 "2024.06.10" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::fpos::state \- std::fpos::state

.SH Synopsis
   State state() const;    \fB(1)\fP
   void state( State st ); \fB(2)\fP

   Manages the file position state.

   1) Returns the value of the file position state.
   2) Replaces the file position state with the value of st.

   For the specializations of std::fpos that are used in the standard library, State is
   always std::mbstate_t.

.SH Parameters

   st - new value for the state

.SH Return value

   1) The current value of the fpos state.
   2) \fI(none)\fP

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <cwchar>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <sstream>

 int main()
 {
     std::istringstream s("test");
     std::mbstate_t st = s.tellg().state();

     if (std::mbsinit(&st))
         std::cout << "The stream is in the initial shift state\\n";
 }

.SH Output:

 The stream is in the initial shift state
