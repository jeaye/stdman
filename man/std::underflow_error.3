.SH NAME
std::underflow_error \- std::underflow_error

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <stdexcept>
   class underflow_error;

   Defines a type of object to be thrown as exception. It may be used to report
   arithmetic underflow errors (that is, situations where the result of a computation
   is a subnormal floating-point value)

   The standard library components do not throw this exception (mathematical functions
   report underflow errors as specified in math_errhandling). Third-party libraries,
   however, use this. For example, boost.math throws std::underflow_error if
   boost::math::policies::throw_on_error is enabled (the default setting).

.SH Member functions

   constructor   constructs the exception object
                 \fI(public member function)\fP 

   

std::underflow_error::underflow_error

   explicit underflow_error( const std::string& what_arg ); \fB(1)\fP
   explicit underflow_error( const char* what_arg );        \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Constructs the exception object with what_arg as explanatory string that can be
   accessed through what().

   Because copying std::underflow_error is not permitted to throw exceptions, this
   message is typically stored internally as a separately-allocated reference-counted
   string. This is also why there is no constructor taking std::string&&: it would have
   to copy the content anyway.

.SH Parameters

   what_arg - explanatory string

   May throw std::bad_alloc
