.SH NAME
std::underflow_error \- std::underflow_error

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <stdexcept>
   class underflow_error;

   Defines a type of object to be thrown as exception. It may be used to report
   arithmetic underflow errors (that is, situations where the result of a computation
   is a subnormal floating-point value).

   The standard library components do not throw this exception (mathematical functions
   report underflow errors as specified in math_errhandling). Third-party libraries,
   however, use this. For example, boost.math throws std::underflow_error if
   boost::math::policies::throw_on_error is enabled (the default setting).

.SH Member functions

   constructor   constructs a new underflow_error object with the given message
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
   operator=     replaces the underflow_error object
                 \fI(public member function)\fP

std::underflow_error::underflow_error

   underflow_error( const std::string& what_arg );  \fB(1)\fP
   underflow_error( const char* what_arg );         \fB(2)\fP
   underflow_error( const underflow_error& other ); \fB(3)\fP (noexcept since C++11)

   1) Constructs the exception object with what_arg as explanatory string. After
   construction, std::strcmp(what(), what_arg.c_str()) == 0.
   2) Constructs the exception object with what_arg as explanatory string. After
   construction, std::strcmp(what(), what_arg) == 0.
   3) Copy constructor. If *this and other both have dynamic type std::underflow_error
   then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0. No exception can be thrown from the
   copy constructor.

.SH Parameters

   what_arg - explanatory string
   other    - another exception object to copy

.SH Exceptions

   1,2) May throw std::bad_alloc.

.SH Notes

   Because copying std::underflow_error is not permitted to throw exceptions, this
   message is typically stored internally as a separately-allocated reference-counted
   string. This is also why there is no constructor taking std::string&&: it would have
   to copy the content anyway.

   Before the resolution of LWG issue 254, the non-copy constructor can only accept
   std::string. It makes dynamic allocation mandatory in order to construct a
   std::string object.

   After the resolution of LWG issue 471, a derived standard exception class must have
   a publicly accessible copy constructor. It can be implicitly defined as long as the
   explanatory strings obtained by what() are the same for the original object and the
   copied object.

std::underflow_error::operator=

   underflow_error& operator=( const underflow_error& other );  (noexcept since C++11)

   Assigns the contents with those of other. If *this and other both have dynamic type
   std::underflow_error then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0 after assignment.
   No exception can be thrown from the copy assignment operator.

.SH Parameters

   other - another exception object to assign with

.SH Return value

   *this

.SH Notes

   After the resolution of LWG issue 471, a derived standard exception class must have
   a publicly accessible copy assignment operator. It can be implicitly defined as long
   as the explanatory strings obtained by what() are the same for the original object
   and the copied object.
