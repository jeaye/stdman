.SH NAME
std::showpoint,std::noshowpoint \- std::showpoint,std::noshowpoint

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <ios>
   std::ios_base& showpoint( std::ios_base& str );   \fB(1)\fP
   std::ios_base& noshowpoint( std::ios_base& str ); \fB(2)\fP

   Enables or disables the unconditional inclusion of the decimal point character in
   floating-point output. Has no effect on input.

   1) enables the showpoint flag in the stream str as if by calling
   str.setf(std::ios_base::showpoint)
   2) disables the showpoint flag in the stream str as if by calling
   str.unsetf(std::ios_base::showpoint)

   This is an I/O manipulator, it may be called with an expression such as out <<
   std::showpoint for any out of type std::basic_ostream or with an expression such as
   in >> std::showpoint for any in of type std::basic_istream.

   The character to use as decimal point character is determined by the numpunct facet
   of the locale imbued in the stream at the time of output, as described in
   std::num_put::put

.SH Parameters

   str - reference to I/O stream

.SH Return value

   str (reference to the stream after manipulation)

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 int main()
 {
     std::cout << "1.0 with showpoint: " << std::showpoint << 1.0 << '\\n'
               << "1.0 with noshowpoint: " << std::noshowpoint << 1.0 << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 1.0 with showpoint: 1.00000
 1.0 with noshowpoint: 1
