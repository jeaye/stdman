.SH NAME
std::greater \- std::greater

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <functional>
   template< class T >             \fI(until C++14)\fP
   struct greater;
   template< class T = void >      \fI(since C++14)\fP
   struct greater;

   Function object for performing comparisons. Unless specialized, invokes operator> on
   type T.

.SH Specializations

   A specialization of std::greater for any pointer type yields a strict total order,
   even if the built-in operator> does not. The strict total order is consistent among
   specializations of std::less, std::greater, std::less_equal, and std::greater_equal
   for that pointer type, and is also consistent with the partial order imposed by the
   corresponding built-in operators (<, >, <= and >=).

   If the function call operator of the specialization std::greater<void>
   calls a built-in operator comparing pointers, it yields a strict total
   order even if the built-in operator> does not. This strict total order
   is consistent among the specializations std::less<void>,               \fI(since C++14)\fP
   std::greater<void>, std::less_equal<void>, and
   std::greater_equal<void>, and is also consistent with the partial
   order imposed by the corresponding built-in operators.

   The standard library provides a specialization of std::greater when T
   is not specified, which leaves the parameter types and return type to
   be deduced.

                 function object implementing x > y deducing argument and
   greater<void> return types

.SH Member functions

   operator() checks if the first argument is greater than the second

std::greater::operator()

   bool operator()( const T& lhs, const T& rhs ) const;            \fI(until C++14)\fP

   Checks whether lhs is greater than rhs.

.SH Parameters
