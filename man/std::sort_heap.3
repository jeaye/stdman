   Defined in header <algorithm>
   template< class RandomIt >                               \fI(until C++20)\fP
   void sort_heap( RandomIt first, RandomIt last );

   void sort_heap( RandomIt first, RandomIt last,                         \fI(until C++20)\fP
   Compare comp );                                      \fB(2)\fP
   template< class RandomIt, class Compare >
   constexpr void sort_heap( RandomIt first,                              \fI(since C++20)\fP
   RandomIt last, Compare comp );

   Converts the max heap [first, last) into a sorted range in ascending order. The
   resulting range no longer has the heap property.

   The first version of the function uses operator< to compare the elements, the second
   uses the given comparison function comp.

.SH Parameters

   first, last -  the range of elements to sort
                  comparison function object (i.e. an object that satisfies the
                  requirements of Compare) which returnstrue if the first argument is
                  less than the second.

                  The signature of the comparison function should be equivalent to the
                  following:

                   bool cmp(const Type1 &a, const Type2 &b);
   comp        -
                  While the signature does not need to have const &, the function must
                  not modify the objects passed to it and must be able to accept all
                  values of type (possibly const) Type1 and Type2 regardless of value
                  category (thus, Type1 & is not allowed
                  , nor is Type1 unless for Type1 a move is equivalent to a copy
                  \fI(since C++11)\fP).
                  The types Type1 and Type2 must be such that an object of type
                  RandomIt can be dereferenced and then implicitly converted to both of
                  them.
.SH Type requirements
   -
   RandomIt must meet the requirements of ValueSwappable and
   LegacyRandomAccessIterator.
   -
   The type of dereferenced RandomIt must meet the requirements of MoveAssignable and
   MoveConstructible.

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Complexity

   At most 2×N×log(N) comparisons where N=std::distance(first, last).

.SH Notes

   A max heap is a range of elements [f,l) that has the following properties:

     * With N = l - f, for all 0 < i < N, f[floor(

       i-1
       2

       )] does not compare less than f[i].
     * a new element can be added using std::push_heap()
     * the first element can be removed using std::pop_heap()

   Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to
   previously published C++ standards.

      DR    Applied to              Behavior as published              Correct behavior
   LWG 2444 C++98      complexity requirement was wrong by a factor of corrected

.SH Possible implementation

.SH First version
   template< class RandomIt >
   void sort_heap( RandomIt first, RandomIt last )
   {
       while (first != last)
           std::pop_heap(first, last--);
   }
.SH Second version
   template< class RandomIt, class Compare >
   void sort_heap( RandomIt first, RandomIt last, Compare comp )
   {
       while (first != last)
           std::pop_heap(first, last--, comp);
   }

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <algorithm>
 #include <vector>
 #include <iostream>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::vector<int> v = {3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9};
  
     std::make_heap(v.begin(), v.end());
  
     std::cout << "heap:\\t";
     for (const auto &i : v) {
         std::cout << i << ' ';
     }
  
     std::sort_heap(v.begin(), v.end());
  
     std::cout << "\\nsorted:\\t";
     for (const auto &i : v) {
         std::cout << i << ' ';
     }
     std::cout << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 heap:   9 4 5 1 1 3
 sorted: 1 1 3 4 5 9
