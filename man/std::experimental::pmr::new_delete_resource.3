.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/memory_resource>
   memory_resource* new_delete_resource();           (library fundamentals TS)

   Returns a pointer to a memory_resource that uses the global operator new and
   operator delete to allocate memory.

.SH Return value

   Returns a pointer p to a static storage duration object of a type derived from
   std::experimental::pmr::memory_resource, with the following properties:

     * its allocate() function uses ::operator new to allocate memory;
     * its deallocate() function uses ::operator delete to deallocate memory;
     * for any memory_resource r, p->is_equal(r) returns &r == p.

   The same value is returned every time this function is called.
