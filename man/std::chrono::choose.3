.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <chrono>
   enum class choose {

       earliest,               \fI(since C++20)\fP
       latest

   };

   The scoped enumeration choose can be passed to certain member functions of
   std::chrono::time_zone and std::chrono::zoned_time to control how ambiguous or
   nonexistent local times should be resolved. Passing choose::earliest causes the
   earlier time point to be returned, while passing choose::latest causes the later
   time point to be returned. (For nonexistent local times, these two time points are
   identical.)

   If a choose is not passed and an ambiguous or nonexistent local time is encountered,
   a std::chrono::ambiguous_local_time or std::chrono::nonexistent_local_time exception
   (as applicable) will be thrown.
