.SH NAME
std::basic_streambuf::pubsync,std::basic_streambuf::sync \- std::basic_streambuf::pubsync,std::basic_streambuf::sync

.SH Synopsis
   int pubsync();      \fB(1)\fP
   protected:          \fB(2)\fP
   virtual int sync();

   Synchronizes the controlled character sequence (the buffers) with the associated
   character sequence.

   1) Calls sync() of the most derived class

   2) The base class version of this function has no effect. The derived classes may
   override this function to allow synchronizing the underlying device with the
   buffers.

   For output streams, this typically results in writing the contents of the put area
   into the associated sequence, i.e. flushing of the output buffer. For input streams,
   this typically empties the get area and forces a re-read from the associated
   sequence to pick up recent changes. The default behavior (found, for example, in
   std::basic_stringbuf), is to do nothing.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   1) The return value of sync().

   2) Returns 0 on success, -1 otherwise. The base class version returns 0.
