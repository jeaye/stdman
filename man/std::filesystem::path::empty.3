.SH NAME
std::filesystem::path::empty \- std::filesystem::path::empty

.SH Synopsis
   bool empty() const noexcept;                \fI(since C++17)\fP
                                               \fI(until C++20)\fP
   [[nodiscard]] bool empty() const noexcept;  \fI(since C++20)\fP

   Checks if the path in generic format is empty.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   true if the path is empty, false otherwise.

.SH Notes

   An empty path can be obtained by calling clear and by default-constructing a path.
   It can also be returned by a path decomposition function (such as extension) if the
   corresponding component is not present in the path.

   An empty path is classified as a relative path.
