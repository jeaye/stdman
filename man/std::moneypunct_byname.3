.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <locale>
   template< class CharT, bool Intl = false >
   class moneypunct_byname : public std::moneypunct<CharT, Intl>;

   std::moneypunct_byname is a std::moneypunct facet which encapsulates monetary
   formatting preferences of a locale specified at its construction.

   Two specializations are provided by the standard library

   Defined in header <locale>
   std::moneypunct_byname<char, Intl>    locale-specific std::moneypunct facet for
                                         narrow character I/O
   std::moneypunct_byname<wchar_t, Intl> locale-specific std::moneypunct facet for wide
                                         character I/O

.SH Member functions

   constructor   constructs a new moneypunct_byname facet
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
   destructor    destroys a moneypunct_byname facet
                 \fI(protected member function)\fP

                        std::moneypunct_byname::moneypunct_byname

   explicit moneypunct_byname( const char* name, std::size_t refs = 0 );
   explicit moneypunct_byname( const std::string& name, std::size_t refs  \fI(since C++11)\fP
   = 0 );

   Constructs a new std::moneypunct_byname facet for a locale with name.

   refs is used for resource management: if refs == 0, the implementation destroys the
   facet, when the last std::locale object holding it is destroyed. Otherwise, the
   object is not destroyed.

.SH Parameters

   name - the name of the locale
   refs - the number of references that link to the facet

                        std::moneypunct_byname::~moneypunct_byname

   protected:
   ~moneypunct_byname();

   Destroys the facet.

.SH Example

   This example demonistrates how to apply monetary formatting rules of another
   language without changing the rest of the locale.

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <iomanip>
 #include <locale>
 int main()
 {
     long double mon = 1234567;
     std::locale::global(std::locale("en_US.utf8"));
     std::wcout.imbue(std::locale());
     std::wcout << L"american locale : " << std::showbase
                << std::put_money(mon) << '\\n';
     std::wcout.imbue(std::locale(std::wcout.getloc(),
                                  new std::moneypunct_byname<wchar_t>("ru_RU.utf8")));
     std::wcout << L"american locale with russian moneypunct: "
                << std::put_money(mon) << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 american locale : $12,345.67
 american locale with russian moneypunct: 12 345.67 руб
