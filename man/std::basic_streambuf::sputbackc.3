.SH NAME
std::basic_streambuf::sputbackc \- std::basic_streambuf::sputbackc

.SH Synopsis
   int_type sputbackc( char_type c );

   Puts back a character back to the get area.

   If a putback position is available in the get area (gptr() > eback()), and the
   character c is equal to the character one position to the left of gptr() (as
   determined by Traits::eq(c, gptr()[-1]), then simply decrements the next pointer
   (gptr()).

   Otherwise, calls pbackfail(Traits::to_int_type(c)) to either back up the get area or
   to modify both the get area and possibly the associated character sequence.

   The I/O stream function basic_istream::putback is implemented in terms of this
   function.

.SH Parameters

   c - character to put back

.SH Return value

   If putback position was available, returns the character that the next pointer is
   now pointing at, converted to int_type with Traits::to_int_type(*gptr()). The next
   single-character input from this streambuf will return this character.

   If putback position was not available, returns what pbackfail() returns, which is
   Traits::eof() on failure.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <sstream>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::stringstream s("abcdef"); // gptr() points to 'a' in "abcdef"
     std::cout << "Before putback, string holds " << s.str() << '\\n';
     char c1 = s.get(); // c1 = 'a', gptr() now points to 'b' in "abcdef"
     char c2 = s.rdbuf()->sputbackc('z'); // same as s.putback('z')
                                          // gptr() now points to 'z' in "zbcdef"
     std::cout << "After putback, string holds " << s.str() << '\\n';
     char c3 = s.get(); // c3 = 'z', gptr() now points to 'b' in "zbcdef"
     char c4 = s.get(); // c4 = 'b', gptr() now points to 'c' in "zbcdef"
     std::cout << c1 << c2 << c3 << c4 << '\\n';
  
     s.rdbuf()->sputbackc('b');  // gptr() now points to 'b' in "zbcdef"
     s.rdbuf()->sputbackc('z');  // gptr() now points to 'z' in "zbcdef"
     int eof = s.rdbuf()->sputbackc('x');  // nothing to unget: pbackfail() fails
     if (eof == EOF)
         std::cout << "No room to putback after 'z'\\n";
 }

.SH Output:

 Before putback, string holds abcdef
 After putback, string holds zbcdef
 azzb
 No room to putback after 'z'
