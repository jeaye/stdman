.TH std::basic_streambuf::sputbackc 3 "Nov 25 2015" "2.1 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::basic_streambuf::sputbackc \- std::basic_streambuf::sputbackc

.SH Synopsis
   int_type sputbackc( char_type c );

   Puts back a character back to the get area.

   If a putback position is available in the get area (gptr() > eback()), and the
   character c is equal to the character one position to the left of gptr() (as
   determined by Traits::eq(c, gptr()[-1]), then simply decrements the next pointer
   (gptr()).

   Otherwise, calls pbackfail(Traits::to_int_type(c)) to either back up the get area or
   to modify both the get area and possibly the associated character sequence.

   The I/O stream function basic_istream::putback is implemented in terms of this
   function.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   If putback position was available, returns the character that the next pointer is
   now pointing at, converted to int_type with Traits::to_int_type(*gptr()). The next
   single-character input from this streambuf will return this character.

   If putback position was not available, returns what pbackfail() returns, which is
   Traits::eof() on failure.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <sstream>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::stringstream s("abcdef"); // gptr() points to 'a' in "abcdef"
     std::cout << "Before putback, string holds " << s.str() << '\\n';
     char c1 = s.get(); // c1 = 'a', gptr() now points to 'b' in "abcdef"
     char c2 = s.rdbuf()->sputbackc('z'); // same as s.putback('z')
                                          // gptr() now points to 'z' in "zbcdef"
     std::cout << "After putback, string holds " << s.str() << '\\n';
     char c3 = s.get(); // c3 = 'z', gptr() now points to 'b' in "zbcdef"
     char c4 = s.get(); // c4 = 'b', gptr() now points to 'c' in "zbcdef"
     std::cout << c1 << c2 << c3 << c4 << '\\n';
  
     s.rdbuf()->sputbackc('b');  // gptr() now points to 'b' in "zbcdef"
     s.rdbuf()->sputbackc('z');  // gptr() now points to 'z' in "zbcdef"
     int eof = s.rdbuf()->sputbackc('x');  // nothing to unget: pbackfail() fails
     if (eof == EOF)
         std::cout << "No room to putback after 'z'\\n";
 }

.SH Output:

 Before putback, string holds abcdef
 After putback, string holds zbcdef
 azzb
 No room to putback after 'z'
