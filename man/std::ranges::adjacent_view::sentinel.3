std::ranges::adjacent_view::sentinel \- std::ranges::adjacent_view::sentinel

.SH Synopsis
   template< bool Const >  (exposition only*)
   class /*sentinel*/;     (since C++23)

   The return type of adjacent_view::end when the underlying view is not a
   common_range.

   The type /*sentinel*/<true> is returned by the const-qualified overload. The type
   /*sentinel*/<false> is returned by the non-const-qualified overload.

.SH Member types

   Member type    Definition
   Base (private) const V if Const is true, otherwise V.
                  (exposition-only member type*)

   Data members

   Member object  Definition
   end_ (private) A sentinel obtained from (possibly const-qualified) V.
                  (exposition-only member object*)

.SH Member functions
