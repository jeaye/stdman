.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <memory>
   template< class T > class weak_ptr;  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   std::weak_ptr is a smart pointer that holds a non-owning ("weak") reference to an
   object that is managed by std::shared_ptr. It must be converted to std::shared_ptr
   in order to access the referenced object.

   std::weak_ptr models temporary ownership: when an object needs to be accessed only
   if it exists, and it may be deleted at any time by someone else, std::weak_ptr is
   used to track the object, and it is converted to std::shared_ptr to assume temporary
   ownership. If the original std::shared_ptr is destroyed at this time, the object's
   lifetime is extended until the temporary std::shared_ptr is destroyed as well.

   In addition, std::weak_ptr is used to break circular references of std::shared_ptr.

.SH Notes

   Like std::shared_ptr, a typical implementation of weak_ptr stores two pointers:

     * a pointer to the control block; and
     * the stored pointer of the shared_ptr it was constructed from.

   A separate stored pointer is necessary to ensure that converting a shared_ptr to
   weak_ptr and then back works correctly, even for aliased shared_ptrs. It is not
   possible to access the stored pointer in a weak_ptr without locking it into a
   shared_ptr.

   Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to
   previously published C++ standards.

.SH Example

   Demonstrates how lock is used to ensure validity of the pointer.

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <memory>
  
 std::weak_ptr<int> gw;
  
 void observe()
 {
     std::cout << "use_count == " << gw.use_count() << ": ";
     if (auto spt = gw.lock()) { // Has to be copied into a shared_ptr before usage
         std::cout << *spt << "\\n";
     }
     else {
         std::cout << "gw is expired\\n";
     }
 }
  
 int main()
 {
     {
         auto sp = std::make_shared<int>(42);
         gw = sp;
  
         observe();
     }
  
     observe();
 }

.SH Output:

 use_count == 1: 42
 use_count == 0: gw is expired
