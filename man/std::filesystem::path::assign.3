.SH Synopsis
   path& assign( string_type&& source );        \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   template< class Source >                     \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   path& assign( const Source& source );
   template< class InputIt >                    \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   path& assign( InputIt first, InputIt last );

   Replaces the contents to the path object by a new pathname constructed from the
   given character sequence.

   1) Assigns the pathname identified by the detected-format string source, which is
   left in valid, but unspecified state.
   2) Assigns the pathname identified by the detected-format character range source.
   3) Assigns the pathname identified by detected-format character range [first, last).

.SH Parameters

                 a character range to use, represented as std::string,
   source      - std::string_view, pointer to a null-terminated multibyte string, or as
                 an input iterator with char value type that points to a
                 null-terminated multibyte string
   first, last - a character range to use
.SH Type requirements
   -
   InputIt must meet the requirements of LegacyInputIterator.
   -
   The value type of InputIt must be one of the encoded character types (char, wchar_t,
   char16_t and char32_t)

.SH Return value
