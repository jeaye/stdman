std::variant \- std::variant

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <variant>
   template <class... Types>    \fI(since C++17)\fP
   class variant;

   The class template std::variant represents a type-safe union. An instance of
   std::variant at any given time either holds a value of one of its alternative types,
   or in the case of error - no value (this state is hard to achieve, see
   valueless_by_exception).

   As with unions, if a variant holds a value of some object type T, the object
   representation of T is allocated directly within the object representation of the
   variant itself. Variant is not allowed to allocate additional (dynamic) memory.

   A variant is not permitted to hold references, arrays, or the type void. Empty
   variants are also ill-formed (std::variant<std::monostate> can be used instead).

   A variant is permitted to hold the same type more than once, and to hold differently
   cv-qualified versions of the same type.

   Consistent with the behavior of unions during aggregate initialization, a
   default-constructed variant holds a value of its first alternative, unless that
   alternative is not default-constructible (in which case the variant is not
   default-constructible either). The helper class std::monostate can be used to make
   such variants default-constructible.

.SH Template parameters

   Types - the types that may be stored in this variant. All types must be (possibly
           cv-qualified) non-array object types.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <variant>
 #include <string>
 #include <cassert>
  
 using namespace std::literals;
  
 int main()
 {
     std::variant<int, float> v, w;
     v = 12; // v contains int
     int i = std::get<int>(v);
     w = std::get<int>(v);
     w = std::get<0>(v); // same effect as the previous line
     w = v; // same effect as the previous line
  
 //  std::get<double>(v); // error: no double in [int, float]
 //  std::get<3>(v);      // error: valid index values are 0 and 1
  
     try {
       std::get<float>(w); // w contains int, not float: will throw
     }
     catch (const std::bad_variant_access&) {}
  
     std::variant<std::string> x("abc"); // converting constructors work when unambiguous
     x = "def"; // converting assignment also works when unambiguous
  
     std::variant<std::string, bool> y("abc"); // casts to bool when passed a char const *
     assert(std::holds_alternative<bool>(y)); // succeeds
     y = "xyz"s;
     assert(std::holds_alternative<std::string>(y)); //succeeds
