.SH Synopsis

   reverse_iterator rbegin();                        \fI(until C++11)\fP
   reverse_iterator rbegin() noexcept;               \fI(since C++11)\fP
   const_reverse_iterator rbegin() const;            \fI(until C++11)\fP
   const_reverse_iterator rbegin() const noexcept;   \fI(since C++11)\fP
   const_reverse_iterator crbegin() const noexcept;  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Returns a reverse iterator to the first element of the reversed container. It
   corresponds to the last element of the non-reversed container. If the container is
   empty, the returned iterator is equal to rend().

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   Reverse iterator to the first element.

.SH Complexity

   Constant.

.SH Notes

   Because both iterator and const_iterator are constant iterators (and may in fact be
   the same type), it is not possible to mutate the elements of the container through
   an iterator returned by any of these member functions.
