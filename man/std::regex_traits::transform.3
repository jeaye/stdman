.SH NAME
std::regex_traits::transform \- std::regex_traits::transform

.SH Synopsis
   template< class ForwardIt >
   string_type transform( ForwardIt first, ForwardIt last) const;

   Obtains the sort key for the character sequence [first, last), such that if a sort
   key compares less than another sort key with operator<, then the character sequence
   that produced the first sort key comes before the character sequence that produced
   the second sort key, in the currently imbued locale's collation order.

   For example when the regex flag std::regex_constants::collate is set, then the
   sequence [a-b] would match some character c1 if traits.transform("a") <=
   traits.transform(c1) <= traits.transform("b"). Note that this function takes a
   character sequence as the argument to accomodate to the ranges defined like
   [[.ae.]-d].

   Standard library specializations of std::regex_traits return
   std::use_facet<std::collate<CharT>>(getloc()).transform(&*str.begin(), &*str.begin()
   + str.length()) for some temporary string str constructed as string_type str(first,
   last).

.SH Parameters

   first, last - a pair of ForwardIterators which determines the sequence of characters
                 to compare
.SH Type requirements
   -
   ForwardIt must meet the requirements of ForwardIterator.

.SH Return value

   The collation key for the character sequence [first, last) in the currently imbued
   locale.
