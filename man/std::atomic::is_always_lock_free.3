.SH NAME
std::atomic::is_always_lock_free \- std::atomic::is_always_lock_free

.SH Synopsis
   static constexpr bool is_always_lock_free =                            \fI(since C++17)\fP
   /*implementation-defined*/;

   Equals true if this atomic type is always lock-free and false if it is never or
   sometimes lock-free.

   The value of this constant is consistent with both the macro ATOMIC_xxx_LOCK_FREE,
   where defined, with the member function is_lock_free and non-member function
   std::atomic_is_lock_free.

.SH Notes

   There is no non-member function equivalent of this static member constant because
   non-member functions take pointers to atomic types, and therefore aren't as useful
   in constant expressions.
