.SH NAME
std::strstreambuf::~strstreambuf \- std::strstreambuf::~strstreambuf

.SH Synopsis
   virtual ~strstreambuf();

   Destroys a std::strstreambuf object. if the object is managing a
   dynamically-allocated buffer (the buffer state is "allocated") and if the object is
   not frozen, then deallocates the buffer using the deallocation function provided at
   construction or delete[] if none was provided.

.SH Parameters

   (none0

.SH Notes

   This destructor is typically called by the destructor of std::strstream

   If str() was called on a dynamic strstream and freeze(false) was not called after
   that, this destructor leaks memory.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <strstream>
 #include <iostream>

 void* my_alloc(size_t n)
 {
     std::cout << "my_alloc(" << n << ") called\\n";
     return new char[n];
 }

 void my_free(void* p)
 {
     std::cout << "my_free() called\\n";
     delete[] (char*)p;
 }

 int main()
 {
     {
         std::strstreambuf buf(my_alloc, my_free);
         std::ostream s(&buf);
         s << 1.23 << std::ends;
         std::cout << buf.str() << '\\n';
         buf.freeze(false);
     } // destructor called here, buffer deallocated

     {
         std::strstreambuf buf(my_alloc, my_free);
         std::ostream s(&buf);
         s << 1.23 << std::ends;
         std::cout << buf.str() << '\\n';
 //        buf.freeze(false);
     } // destructor called here, memory leak!
 }

.SH Output:

 my_alloc(4096) called
 1.23
 my_free() called
 my_alloc(4096) called
 1.23
