.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <memory>
   static element_type* to_address(pointer p)          \fI(since C++20)\fP
   noexcept;                                       \fB(1)\fP (optional member of user-defined
                                                       specialization)

   Constructs a raw pointer that references the same object as its pointer-like ("fancy
   pointer") argument.

   This function, if defined, is the inverse of pointer_to, and exists as the
   customization point to be called by std::to_address.

.SH Parameters

   p - fancy pointer/pointer-like object

.SH Return value

   A raw pointer of the type element_type* that references the same memory location as
   the argument p
