.SH NAME
std::unordered_map::clear \- std::unordered_map::clear

.SH Synopsis
   void clear() noexcept;  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Removes all elements from the container. After this call, size() returns zero.

   Invalidates any references, pointers, or iterators referring to contained elements.
   May also invalidate past-the-end iterators.

.SH Parameters

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Complexity

   Linear in the size of the container, i.e., the number of elements.
