.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/atomic>
   template < class T >                     (concurrency TS)
   class atomic_weak_ptr;

   The class template atomic_weak_ptr provides thread-safe atomic pointer operations
   over a std::weak_ptr.

.SH Member functions

   constructor             constructs an atomic_weak_ptr object
                           \fI(public member function)\fP 
   operator=               stores a value into an atomic_weak_ptr object
                           \fI(public member function)\fP 
   is_lock_free            checks if the atomic_weak_ptr object is lock-free
                           \fI(public member function)\fP 
                           atomically replaces the value of the atomic object with a
   store                   non-atomic argument
                           \fI(public member function)\fP 
   load                    atomically obtains the value of the atomic object
                           \fI(public member function)\fP 
   operator weak_ptr<T>    loads a value from an atomic object
                           \fI(public member function)\fP 
                           atomically replaces the value of the atomic object and
   exchange                obtains the value held previously
                           \fI(public member function)\fP 
                           atomically compares the value of the atomic object with
   compare_exchange_weak   non-atomic argument and performs atomic exchange if equal or
   compare_exchange_strong atomic load if not
                           \fI(public member function)\fP
