.SH NAME
std::codecvt::length,do_length \- std::codecvt::length,do_length

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <locale>
   public:

   int length( StateT& state,
               const ExternT* from,                \fB(1)\fP
               const ExternT* from_end,

               std::size_t max ) const;
   protected:

   virtual int do_length( StateT& state,
                          const ExternT* from,     \fB(2)\fP
                          const ExternT* from_end,

                          std::size_t max ) const;

   1) public member function, calls the member function do_length of the most derived
   class.
   2) attempts to convert the externT characters from the character array defined by
   [from, from_end), given initial conversion state state, to at most max internT
   characters, and returns the number of externT characters that such conversion would
   consume. Modifies state as if by executing do_in(state, from, from_end, from, to,
   to+max, to) for some imaginary [to, to+max) output buffer.

.SH Return value

   The number of externT characters that would be consumed if converted by do_in()
   until either all from_end-from characters were consumed or max internT characters
   were produced, or a conversion error occurred.

   The non-converting specialization std::codecvt<char, char, std::mbstate_t> returns
   std::min(max, from_end-from)

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <locale>
 #include <string>
 #include <iostream>

 int main()
 {
     //  narrow multibyte encoding
     std::string s = "z\\u00df\\u6c34\\U0001d10b"; // or u8"zß水𝄋"
                       // or "\\x7a\\xc3\\x9f\\xe6\\xb0\\xb4\\xf0\\x9d\\x84\\x8b";
     std::mbstate_t mb = std::mbstate_t();
     std::cout << "Only the first " <<
               std::use_facet<std::codecvt<wchar_t, char, std::mbstate_t>>(
                     std::locale("en_US.utf8")
               ).length(mb, &s[0], &s[s.size()], 2)
               << " bytes out of " << s.size() << " would be consumed "
                  " to produce the first 2 characters\\n";
 }

.SH Output:

 Only the first 3 bytes out of 10 would be consumed to produce the first 2 characters
