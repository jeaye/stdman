   If multiple threads of execution access the same std::shared_ptr object without
   synchronization and any of those accesses uses a non-const member function of
   shared_ptr then a data race will occur unless all such access is performed through
   these functions, which are overloads of the corresponding atomic access functions
   (std::atomic_load, std::atomic_store, etc.)

   Note that the control block of a shared_ptr is thread-safe: different
   std::shared_ptr objects can be accessed using mutable operations, such as operator=
   or reset, simultaneously by multiple threads, even when these instances are copies,
   and share the same control block internally.

   1) Determines whether atomic access to the shared pointer pointed-to by p is
   lock-free.
   2) Equivalent to atomic_load_explicit(p, std::memory_order_seq_cst)
   3) Returns the shared pointer pointed-to by p. As with the non-specialized
   std::atomic_load_explicit, mo cannot be std::memory_order_release or
   std::memory_order_acq_rel
   4) Equivalent to atomic_store_explicit(p, r, memory_order_seq_cst)
   5) Stores the shared pointer r in the shared pointer pointed-to by p atomically,
   effectively executing p->swap(r). As with the non-specialized
   std::atomic_store_explicit, mo cannot be std::memory_order_acquire or
   std::memory_order_acq_rel.
   6) Equivalent to atomic_exchange_explicit(p, r, memory_order_seq_cst)
   7) Stores the shared pointer r in the shared pointer pointed to by p and returns the
   value formerly pointed-to by p, atomically. Effectively executes p->swap(r) and
   returns a copy of r after the swap.
   8) Equivalent to atomic_compare_exchange_weak_explicit(p, expected, desired,
   std::memory_order_seq_cst, std::memory_order_seq_cst)
   9) Equivalent to atomic_compare_exchange_strong_explicit(p, expected, desired,
   std::memory_order_seq_cst, std::memory_order_seq_cst)
   10) Compares the shared pointers pointed-to by p and expected. If they are
   equivalent (store the same pointer value, and either share ownership of the same
   object or are both empty), assigns desired into *p using the memory ordering
   constraints specified by success and returns true. If they are not equivalent,
   assigns *p into *expected using the memory ordering constraints specified by failure
   and returns false.
   11) Same as 10), but may fail spuriously.

   All these functions invoke undefined behavior if p is a null pointer.

.SH Parameters

   p, expected          - a pointer to a std::shared_ptr
   r, desired           - a std::shared_ptr
   mo, success, failure - memory ordering selectors of type std::memory_order

.SH Exceptions

   These functions do not throw exceptions.

.SH Return value

   1) true if atomic access is implemented using lock-free instructions
   2,3) A copy of the pointed-to shared pointer.
   4,5) \fI(none)\fP
   6,7) A copy of the formerly pointed-to shared pointer
   8,9,10,11) true if the shared pointers were equivalent and the exchange was
   performed, false otherwise.

.SH Notes

   These functions are typically implemented using mutexes, stored in a global hash
   table where the pointer value is used as the key.

   To avoid data races, once a shared pointer is passed to any of these functions, it
   cannot be accessed non-atomically. In particular, you cannot dereference such a
   shared_ptr without first atomically loading it into another shared_ptr object, and
   then dereferencing through the second object.

   The Concurrency TS offers atomic smart pointer classes atomic_shared_ptr and
   atomic_weak_ptr as a replacement for the use of these functions.

   These functions were deprecated in favor of the specializations of the
   std::atomic template: std::atomic<std::shared_ptr> and                 \fI(since C++20)\fP
   std::atomic<std::weak_ptr>.
