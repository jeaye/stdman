.SH NAME
std::basic_ios::narrow \- std::basic_ios::narrow

.SH Synopsis
   char narrow( char_type c, char dfault ) const;

   Converts a current locale-specific character c to its standard equivalent. The
   result is converted from char_type to char if needed. If no conversion can be
   performed, the function returns dfault.

   Effectively calls std::use_facet< std::ctype<char_type> >(getloc()).narrow(c,
   dfault);.

.SH Parameters

   c      - character to convert
   dfault - character to return if the conversion was unsuccessful

.SH Return value

   Character converted to its standard equivalent and then to char. dfault is returned
   if the conversion fails.
