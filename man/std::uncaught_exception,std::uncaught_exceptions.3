.SH NAME
std::uncaught_exception,std::uncaught_exceptions \- std::uncaught_exception,std::uncaught_exceptions

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <exception>
   bool uncaught_exception();    \fB(1)\fP (deprecated in C++17)
   int uncaught_exceptions();    \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP

   1) Detects if the current thread has a live exception object, that is, an exception
   has been thrown or rethrown and not yet entered a matching catch clause,
   std::terminate or std::unexpected. In other words, std::uncaught_exception detects
   if stack unwinding is currently in progress.
   2) Detects how many exceptions in the current thread have been thrown or rethrown
   and not yet entered their matching catch clauses.

   Sometimes it's safe to throw an exception even while std::uncaught_exception() ==
   true. For example, if stack unwinding causes a stack-allocated object to be
   destructed, the destructor for that object could run code that throws an exception
   as long as the exception is caught by some catch block before escaping the
   destructor.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   1) true if stack unwinding is currently in progress in this thread.
   2) The number of uncaught exception objects in the current thread.

.SH Exceptions

   \fI(none)\fP                  \fI(until C++11)\fP
   noexcept specification: \fI(since C++11)\fP
   noexcept

.SH Notes

   An example where int-returning uncaught_exceptions is used is the boost.log library:
   the expression BOOST_LOG(logger) << foo(); first creates a guard object and records
   the number of uncaught exceptions in its constructor. The output is performed by the
   guard object's destructor unless foo() throws (in which case the number of uncaught
   exceptions in the destructor is greater than what the constructor observed)

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <exception>
 #include <stdexcept>

 struct Foo {
     ~Foo() {
         if (std::uncaught_exception()) {
             std::cout << "~Foo() called during stack unwinding\\n";
         } else {
             std::cout << "~Foo() called normally\\n";
         }
     }
 };
 int main()
 {
     Foo f;
     try {
         Foo f;
         std::cout << "Exception thrown\\n";
         throw std::runtime_error("test exception");
     } catch (const std::exception& e) {
         std::cout << "Exception caught: " << e.what() << '\\n';
     }
 }

.SH Output:

 Exception thrown
 ~Foo() called during stack unwinding
 Exception caught: test exception
 ~Foo() called normally
