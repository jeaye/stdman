.SH NAME
std::basic_streambuf::gbump \- std::basic_streambuf::gbump

.SH Synopsis
   protected:
   void gbump( int count );

   Skips count characters in the get area. This is done by adding count to the get
   pointer. No checks are done for underflow.

.SH Parameters

   count - number of characters to skip

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Notes

   Because this function takes an int, it cannot manipulate buffers larger than
   std::numeric_limits<int>::max() characters (LWG issue 255).

                     it was unclear whether gbump can be implemented
   LWG 59 C++98      as                                              only add count
                     calling sbumpc count times (which may check     to the get pointer
                     underflow)
