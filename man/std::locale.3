.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <locale>
   class locale;

   An object of class std::locale is an immutable indexed set of immutable facets. Each
   stream object of the C++ input/output library is associated with an std::locale
   object and uses its facets for parsing and formatting of all data. In addition, a
   locale object is associated with each std::basic_regex object. Locale objects can
   also be used as predicates that perform string collation with the standard
   containers and algorithms and can be accessed directly to obtain or modify the
   facets they hold.

   Each locale constructed in a C++ program holds at least the following standard
   facets, but a program may define additional specializations or completely new facets
   and add them to any existing locale object.

                                Supported facets
   std::collate<char>                    std::collate<wchar_t>
   std::ctype<char>                      std::ctype<wchar_t>
   std::codecvt<char,char,mbstate_t>     std::codecvt<char32_t,char,mbstate_t>
   std::codecvt<char16_t,char,mbstate_t> std::codecvt<wchar_t,char,mbstate_t>
   std::moneypunct<char>                 std::moneypunct<wchar_t>
   std::moneypunct<char,true>            std::moneypunct<wchar_t,true>
   std::money_get<char>                  std::money_get<wchar_t>
   std::money_put<char>                  std::money_put<wchar_t>
   std::numpunct<char>                   std::numpunct<wchar_t>
   std::num_get<char>                    std::num_get<wchar_t>
   std::num_put<char>                    std::num_put<wchar_t>
   std::time_get<char>                   std::time_get<wchar_t>
   std::time_put<char>                   std::time_put<wchar_t>
   std::messages<char>                   std::messages<wchar_t>

   Internally, a locale object is implemented as-if it is a reference-counted pointer
   to an array (indexed by std::locale::id) of reference-counted pointers to facets:
   copying a locale only copies one pointer and increments several reference counts. To
   maintain the standard C++ library thread safety guarantees (operations on different
   objects are always thread-safe), both the locale reference count and each facet
   reference count are updated in thread-safe manner, similar to std::shared_ptr.

.SH Member types

            the facet index type: each facet class must declare or inherit a public
   id       static member of this type
            \fI(class)\fP 
            the base class for all facet categories: each facet of any category is
   facet    derived from this type
            \fI(class)\fP 
   category int
            \fI(typedef)\fP

.SH Member objects

   none     a zero value of type category indicating no facet category
   \fB[static]\fP \fI(public static member constant)\fP
   collate  a bitmask value of type category indicating the collate facet category
   \fB[static]\fP \fI(public static member constant)\fP
   ctype    a bitmask value of type category indicating the ctype facet category
   \fB[static]\fP \fI(public static member constant)\fP
   monetary a bitmask value of type category indicating the monetary facet category
   \fB[static]\fP \fI(public static member constant)\fP
   numeric  a bitmask value of type category indicating the numeric facet category
   \fB[static]\fP \fI(public static member constant)\fP
   time     a bitmask value of type category indicating the time facet category
   \fB[static]\fP \fI(public static member constant)\fP
   messages a bitmask value of type category indicating the messages facet category
   \fB[static]\fP \fI(public static member constant)\fP
   all      collate | ctype | monetary | numeric | time | messages
   \fB[static]\fP \fI(public static member constant)\fP

.SH Member functions

   constructor   constructs a new locale
                 \fI(public member function)\fP 
   destructor    destructs the locale and the facets whose reference count becomes zero
                 \fI(public member function)\fP 
   operator=     replaces a locale
                 \fI(public member function)\fP 
                 constructs a locale with compile-time identified facet copied from
   combine       another locale
                 \fI(public member function)\fP 
   name          returns the name of the locale or "*" if unnamed
                 \fI(public member function)\fP 
   operator==    equality comparison between locale objects
   operator!=    \fI(public member function)\fP 
                 lexicographically compares two strings using this locale's collate
   operator()    facet
                 \fI(public member function)\fP 
   global        changes the global locale
   \fB[static]\fP      \fI(public static member function)\fP 
   classic       obtains a reference to the "C" locale
   \fB[static]\fP      \fI(public static member function)\fP 

.SH Example

   Demonstrates the typical prologue of a locale-sensitive program (cross-platform)

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <locale>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::wcout << "User-preferred locale setting is " << std::locale("").name().c_str() << '\\n';
     // on startup, the global locale is the "C" locale
     std::wcout << 1000.01 << '\\n';
     // replace the C++ global locale as well as the C locale with the user-preferred locale
     std::locale::global(std::locale(""));
     // use the new global locale for future wide character output
     std::wcout.imbue(std::locale());
     // output the same number again
     std::wcout << 1000.01 << '\\n';
 }

.SH Possible output:

 User-preferred locale setting is en_US.UTF8
 1000.01
 1,000.01
