.SH NAME
std::thread::get_id \- std::thread::get_id

.SH Synopsis
   std::thread::id get_id() const;  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Returns a value of std::thread::id identifying the thread associated with *this.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   A value of type std::thread::id identifying the thread associated with *this. If
   there is no thread associated, default constructed std::thread::id is returned.

.SH Exceptions

   noexcept specification:
   noexcept

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <thread>
 #include <chrono>

 void foo()
 {
     std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
 }

 int main()
 {
     std::thread t1(foo);
     std::thread::id t1_id = t1.get_id();

     std::thread t2(foo);
     std::thread::id t2_id = t2.get_id();

     std::cout << "t1's id: " << t1_id << '\\n';
     std::cout << "t2's id: " << t2_id << '\\n';

     t1.join();
     t2.join();
 }

.SH Possible output:

 t1's id: 0x35a7210f
 t2's id: 0x35a311c4
