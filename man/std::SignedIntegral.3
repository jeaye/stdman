.SH NAME
std::SignedIntegral \- std::SignedIntegral

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <concepts>
   template < class T >                                               \fI(since C++20)\fP
   concept SignedIntegral = std::Integral<T> && std::is_signed_v<T>;

   The concept SignedIntegral<T> is satisfied if and only if T is an integral type and
   std::is_signed_v<T> is true.

.SH Notes

   SignedIntegral<T> may be satisfied by a type that is not a signed integer type, for
   example, char (on a system where char is signed).
