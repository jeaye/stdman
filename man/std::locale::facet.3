.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <locale>
   class locale::facet;

   std::locale::facet is the base class for facets. It provides a common base class so
   that locales could store pointers to the facets they implement in a single indexed
   container, and it abstracts support for facet reference counting. Whenever a facet
   is added to a locale, the locale increments the reference count in the facet
   (through an implementation-specific mechanism). Whenever a locale is destructed or
   modified, it decrements the reference count in each facet it no longer implements.
   Whenever a facet's reference count becomes zero, the locale performs delete
   static_cast<std::locale::facet*>(f) where f is the pointer to the facet.
