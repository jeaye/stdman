.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <locale>
   public:

   result unshift( StateT& state,
                   ExternT* to,                         \fB(1)\fP
                   ExternT* to_end,

                   ExternT*& to_next) const;
   protected:

   virtual result do_unshift( StateT& state,
                              ExternT* to,              \fB(2)\fP
                              ExternT* to_end,

                              ExternT*& to_next) const;

   1) public member function, calls the member function do_unshift of the most derived
   class.
   2) if the encoding represented by this codecvt facet is state-dependent, and state
   represents a conversion state that is not the initial shift state, writes the
   characters necessary to return to the initial shift state. The characters are
   written to a character array whose first element is pointed to by to. No more than
   to_end-to characters are written. The parameter to_next is updated to point one past
   the last character written.

.SH Return value

   A value of type std::codecvt_base::result, indicating the success status as follows:

   ok      all necessary characters were written. state now represents initial shift
           state
   partial not enough space in the output buffer. to_next == to_end
   error   unspecified error occurred
   noconv  the encoding is not state-dependent, no termination sequence necessary

   The non-converting specialization std::codecvt<char, char, std::mbstate_t> always
   returns std::codecvt_base::noconv

.SH Notes

   This function is called by std::basic_filebuf::close() and in other situations when
   finalizing a state-dependent multibyte character sequence.
