.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstdlib>
   std::div_t     div( int x, int y );                         \fB(1)\fP
   std::ldiv_t    div( long x, long y );                       \fB(2)\fP
   std::lldiv_t   div( long long x, long long y );             \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   std::ldiv_t   ldiv( long x, long y );                       \fB(4)\fP
   std::lldiv_t lldiv( long long x, long long y );             \fB(5)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   Defined in header <cinttypes>
   std::imaxdiv_t div( std::intmax_t x, std::intmax_t y );     \fB(6)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   std::imaxdiv_t imaxdiv( std::intmax_t x, std::intmax_t y ); \fB(7)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Computes both the quotient and the remainder of the division of the numerator x by
   the denominator y

   The quotient is the algebraic quotient with any fractional part
   discarded (truncated towards zero). The remainder is such that quot *  \fI(until C++11)\fP
   y + rem == x.
   The quotient is the result of the expression x/y. The remainder is the \fI(since C++11)\fP
   result of the expression x%y.

.SH Parameters

   x, y - integer values

.SH Return value

   If both the remainder and the quotient can be represented as objects of the
   corresponding type (int, long, long long, std::imaxdiv_t, respectively), returns
   both as an object of type std::div_t, std::ldiv_t, std::lldiv_t, std::imaxdiv_t
   defined as follows:

std::div_t

 struct div_t { int quot; int rem; };

   or

 struct div_t { int rem; int quot; };

std::ldiv_t

 struct ldiv_t { long quot; long rem; };

   or

 struct ldiv_t { long rem; long quot; };

std::lldiv_t

 struct lldiv_t { long long quot; long long rem; };

   or

 struct lldiv_t { long long rem; long long quot; };

std::imaxdiv_t

 struct imaxdiv_t { std::intmax_t quot; std::intmax_t rem; };

   or

 struct imaxdiv_t { std::intmax_t rem; std::intmax_t quot; };

   If either the remainder or the quotient cannot be represented, the behavior is
   undefined.

.SH Notes

   Until C++11, the rounding direction of the quotient and the sign of the remainder in
   the built-in division and remainder operators was implementation-defined if either
   of the operands was negative, but it was well-defined in std::div.

   On many platforms, a single CPU instruction obtains both the quotient and the
   remainder, and this function may leverage that, although compilers are generally
   able to merge nearby / and % where suitable.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <string>
 #include <cmath>
 #include <cstdlib>
 #include <iostream>
  
 std::string itoa(int n, int base)
 {
     std::string buf;
     std::div_t dv{}; dv.quot = n;
     do {
         dv = std::div(dv.quot, base);
         buf += "0123456789abcdef"[std::abs(dv.rem)];  // string literals are arrays
     } while(dv.quot);
     if(n<0) buf += '-';
     return {buf.rbegin(), buf.rend()};
 }
  
 int main()
 {
     std::cout << itoa(12345, 10) << '\\n'
               << itoa(-12345, 10) << '\\n'
               << itoa(65535, 16) << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 12345
 -12345
 ffff
