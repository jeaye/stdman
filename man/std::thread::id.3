.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <thread>
   class thread::id;           \fI(since C++11)\fP

   The class thread::id is a lightweight, trivially copyable class that serves as a
   unique identifier of std::thread objects.

   Instances of this class may also hold the special distinct value that does not
   represent any thread. Once a thread has finished, the value of std::thread::id may
   be reused by another thread.

   This class is designed for use as key in associative containers, both ordered and
   unordered.
