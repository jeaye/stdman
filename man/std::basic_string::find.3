   const noexcept(/* see below */);

   Finds the first substring equal to the given character sequence. Search begins at
   pos, i.e. the found substring must not begin in a position preceding pos.

   1) Finds the first substring equal to str.
   2) Finds the first substring equal to the range [s, s+count). This range may contain
   null characters.
   3) Finds the first substring equal to the character string pointed to by s. The
   length of the string is determined by the first null character using
   Traits::length(s).
   4) Finds the first character ch (treated as a single-character substring by the
   formal rules below).
   5) Implicitly converts t to a string view sv as if by std::basic_string_view<CharT,
   Traits> sv = t;, then finds the first substring equal to sv. This overload only
   participates in overload resolution if std::is_convertible_v<const T&,
   std::basic_string_view<CharT, Traits>> is true and std::is_convertible_v<const T&,
   const CharT*> is false.

   Formally, a substring str is said to be found at position xpos if all of the
   following is true:

     * xpos >= pos
     * xpos + str.size() <= size()
     * for all positions n in str, Traits::eq(at(xpos+n), str.at(n))

   In particular, this implies that

     * a substring can be found only if pos <= size() - str.size()
     * an empty substring is found at pos if and only if pos <= size()
     * for a non-empty substring, if pos >= size(), the function always returns npos.

.SH Parameters

   str   - string to search for
   pos   - position at which to start the search
   count - length of substring to search for
   s     - pointer to a character string to search for
   ch    - character to search for
   t     - object (convertible to std::basic_string_view) to search for

.SH Return value

   Position of the first character of the found substring or npos if no such substring
   is found.

.SH Exceptions

   2-3) Throws nothing.
   5)
   noexcept specification:  
   noexcept(std::is_nothrow_convertible_v<const T&, std::basic_string_view<CharT,
   Traits>>)

   Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to
   previously published C++ standards.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <string>
 #include <iostream>
  
 void print(std::string::size_type n, std::string const &s)
 {
     if (n == std::string::npos) {
         std::cout << "not found\\n";
     } else {
         std::cout << "found: " << s.substr(n) << '\\n';
     }
 }
  
 int main()
 {
     std::string::size_type n;
     std::string const s = "This is a string";
  
     // search from beginning of string
     n = s.find("is");
     print(n, s);
  
     // search from position 5
     n = s.find("is", 5);
     print(n, s);
  
     // find a single character
     n = s.find('a');
     print(n, s);
  
     // find a single character
     n = s.find('q');
     print(n, s);
 }
