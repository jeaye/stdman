.SH NAME
std::basic_string::find \- std::basic_string::find

.SH Synopsis
   size_type find( const basic_string& str, size_type pos = 0 ) const;     \fB(1)\fP
   size_type find( const CharT* s, size_type pos, size_type count ) const; \fB(2)\fP
   size_type find( const CharT* s, size_type pos = 0 ) const;              \fB(3)\fP
   size_type find( CharT ch, size_type pos = 0 ) const;                    \fB(4)\fP

   Finds the first substring equal to the given character sequence. Search begins at
   pos, i.e. the found substring must not begin in a position preceding pos.

   1) Finds the first substring equal to str. If str.size() is zero, returns pos.
   2) Finds the first substring equal to the first count characters of the character
   string pointed to by s. s can include null characters. If count is zero, returns
   pos.
   3) Finds the first substring equal to the character string pointed to by s. The
   length of the string is determined by the first null character. If the length of s
   is zero, returns pos.
   4) Finds the first character ch.

   If pos >= size(), the function always returns npos.

.SH Parameters

   str   - string to search for
   pos   - position at which to start the search
   count - length of substring to search for
   s     - pointer to a character string to seach for
   ch    - character to search for

.SH Return value

   Position of the first character of the found substring or npos if no such substring
   is found.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <string>
 #include <iostream>
  
 void print(std::string::size_type n, std::string const &s)
 {
     if (n == std::string::npos) {
         std::cout << "not found\\n";
     } else {
         std::cout << "found: " << s.substr(n) << '\\n';
     }
 }
  
 int main()
 {
     std::string::size_type n;
     std::string const s = "This is a string";
  
     // search from beginning of string
     n = s.find("is");
     print(n, s);
  
     // search from position 5
     n = s.find("is", 5);
     print(n, s);
  
     // find a single character
     n = s.find('a');
     print(n, s);
  
     // find a single character
     n = s.find('q');
     print(n, s);
 }

.SH Output:

 found: is is a string
 found: is a string
 found: a string
 not found
