.SH NAME
std::at_quick_exit \- std::at_quick_exit

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstdlib>
   int at_quick_exit( /*atexit-handler*/* func ) noexcept;            \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   int at_quick_exit( /*c-atexit-handler*/* func ) noexcept;
   extern "C++" using /*atexit-handler*/ = void(); // exposition-only \fB(2)\fP
   extern "C" using /*c-atexit-handler*/ = void(); // exposition-only

   Registers the function pointed to by func to be called on quick program termination
   (via std::quick_exit).

   Calling the function from several threads does not induce a data race. The
   implementation shall support the registration of at least 32 functions.

   The registered functions will not be called on normal program termination. If a
   function need to be called in that case, std::atexit must be used.

.SH Parameters

   func - pointer to a function to be called on quick program termination

.SH Return value

   0 if the registration succeeds, nonzero value otherwise.

.SH Notes

   The two overloads are distinct because the types of the parameter func are distinct
   (language linkage is part of its type)
