.SH NAME
std::chrono::hh_mm_ss \- std::chrono::hh_mm_ss

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <chrono>
   template< class Duration >  \fI(since C++20)\fP
   class hh_mm_ss;

   The class template hh_mm_ss splits a std::chrono::duration into a "broken down" time
   such as hours:minutes:seconds, with the precision of the split determined by the
   Duration template parameter. It is primarily a formatting tool.

   Duration must be a specialization of std::chrono::duration, otherwise the program is
   ill-formed.

.SH Member constants

   constexpr unsigned the smallest possible integer in the range [0, 18] such that
   fractional_width   precision (see below) will exactly represent the value of
   \fB[static]\fP           Duration{1}, or 6 if there's no such integer
                      \fI(public static member constant)\fP
