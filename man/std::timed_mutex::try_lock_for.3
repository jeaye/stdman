.TH std::timed_mutex::try_lock_for 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   template< class Rep, class Period >
   bool try_lock_for( const std::chrono::duration<Rep,Period>&            \fI(since C++11)\fP
   timeout_duration );

   Tries to lock the mutex. Blocks until specified timeout_duration has elapsed or the
   lock is acquired, whichever comes first. On successful lock acquisition returns
   true, otherwise returns false.

   If timeout_duration is less or equal timeout_duration.zero(), the function behaves
   like try_lock().

   A steady clock is used to measure the duration. This function may block for longer
   than timeout_duration due to scheduling or resource contention delays.

   As with try_lock(), this function is allowed to fail spuriously and return false
   even if the mutex was not locked by any other thread at some point during
   timeout_duration.

   Prior unlock() operation on the same mutex synchronizes-with (as defined in
   std::memory_order) this operation if it returns true.

   If try_lock_for is called by a thread that already owns the mutex, the behavior is
   undefined.

.SH Parameters

   timeout_duration - maximum duration to block for

.SH Return value

   true if the lock was acquired successfully, otherwise false.

.SH Exceptions

   Any exception thrown by clock, time_point, or duration during the execution (clocks,
   time points, and durations provided by the standard library never throw)

     for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
         if (mutex.try_lock_for(Ms(100))) {
             stream << "success ";
             std::this_thread::sleep_for(Ms(100));
             mutex.unlock();
         } else {
             stream << "failed ";
         }
         std::this_thread::sleep_for(Ms(100));

     std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(cout_mutex);
