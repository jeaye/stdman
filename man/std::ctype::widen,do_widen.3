   public:                                                                         \fB(1)\fP
   CharT widen( char c ) const;
   public:                                                                         \fB(2)\fP
   const char* widen( const char* beg, const char* end, CharT* dst ) const;
   protected:                                                                      \fB(3)\fP
   virtual CharT do_widen( char c ) const;
   protected:
   virtual const char* do_widen( const char* beg, const char* end, CharT* dst )    \fB(4)\fP
   const;

   1,2) public member function, calls the protected virtual member function do_widen of
   the most derived class.
   3) Converts the single-byte character c to the corresponding wide character
   representation using the simplest reasonable transformation. Typically, this applies
   only to the characters whose multibyte encoding is a single byte (e.g. U+0000-U+007F
   in UTF-8).
   4) For every character in the character array [beg, end), writes the corresponding
   widened character to the successive locations in the character array pointed to by
   dst.

   Widening always returns a wide character, but only the characters from the basic
   source character set (latin letters, digits, and punctuations required to write a
   C++ program) are guaranteed to have a unique, well-defined, widening transformation,
   which is also guaranteed to be reversible (by narrow()). In practice, all characters
   whose multibyte representation is a single byte are usually widened to their wide
   character counterparts, and the rest of the possible single-byte values are usually
   mapped into the same placeholder value, typically CharT(-1).

   Widening, if successful, preserves all character classification categories known to
   is().

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <locale>
 #include <iostream>

 void try_widen(const std::ctype<wchar_t>& f, char c)
 {
     wchar_t w = f.widen(c);
     std::cout << "The single-byte character " << +(unsigned char)c
               << " widens to " << +w << '\\n';
 }

 int main()
 {
     std::locale::global(std::locale("cs_CZ.iso88592"));
     auto& f = std::use_facet<std::ctype<wchar_t>>(std::locale());
     std::cout << std::hex << std::showbase << "In Czech ISO-8859-2 locale:\\n";
     try_widen(f, 'a');
     try_widen(f, '\\xdf'); // German letter ß (U+00df) in ISO-8859-2
     try_widen(f, '\\xec'); // Czech letter ě (U+011b) in ISO-8859-2

     std::locale::global(std::locale("cs_CZ.utf8"));
     auto& f2 = std::use_facet<std::ctype<wchar_t>>(std::locale());
     std::cout << "In Czech UTF-8 locale:\\n";
     try_widen(f2, 'a');
     try_widen(f2, '\\xdf');
     try_widen(f2, '\\xec');
 }

.SH Output:

 In Czech ISO-8859-2 locale:
 The single-byte character 0x61 widens to 0x61
 The single-byte character 0xdf widens to 0xdf
 The single-byte character 0xec widens to 0x11b
 In Czech UTF-8 locale:
 The single-byte character 0x61 widens to 0x61
 The single-byte character 0xdf widens to 0xffffffff
 The single-byte character 0xec widens to 0xffffffff
