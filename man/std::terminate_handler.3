.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <exception>
   typedef void (*terminate_handler)();

   std::terminate_handler is the function pointer type (pointer to function that takes
   no arguments and returns void), which is installed and queried by the functions
   std::set_terminate and std::get_terminate and called by std::terminate.

   The C++ implementation provides a default std::terminate_handler function, which
   calls std::abort(). If the null pointer value is installed (by means of
   std::set_terminate), the implementation may restore the default handler instead.
