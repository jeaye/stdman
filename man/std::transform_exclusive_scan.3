.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <numeric>

             class BinaryOperation, class UnaryOperation>
   OutputIt transform_exclusive_scan( InputIt first, InputIt last,    \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   OutputIt d_first, T init,

                                      BinaryOperation binary_op,
   UnaryOperation unary_op);
   template< class ExecutionPolicy,

             class ForwardIt1, class ForwardIt2,
             class T, class BinaryOperation, class UnaryOperation >
   ForwardIt2 transform_exclusive_scan( ExecutionPolicy&& policy,
                                        ForwardIt1 first, ForwardIt1  \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   last,
                                        ForwardIt2 d_first, T init,

                                        BinaryOperation binary_op,
   UnaryOperation unary_op );

   Transforms each element in the range [first, last) with unary_op, then computes an
   exclusive prefix sum operation using binary_op over the resulting range, with init
   as the initial value, and writes the results to the range beginning at d_first.
   "exclusive" means that the i-th input element is not included in the i-th sum.

   Formally, assigns through each iterator i in [d_first, d_first + (last - first)) the
   value of the generalized noncommutative sum of init, unary_op(*j)... for every j in
   [first, first + (i - d_first)) over binary_op,

   where generalized noncommutative sum GNSUM(op, a
   1, ..., a
   N) is defined as follows:

     * if N=1, a
       1
     * if N > 1, op(GNSUM(op, a
       1, ..., a
       K), GNSUM(op, a
       M, ..., a
       N)) for any K where 1 < K+1 = M â‰¤ N

   In other words, the summation operations may be performed in arbitrary order, and
   the behavior is nondeterministic if binary_op is not associative.

   Overload \fB(2)\fP is executed according to policy, and does not participate in overload
   resolution unless std::is_execution_policy_v<std::decay_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true.

   unary_op and binary_op shall not invalidate iterators (including the end iterators)
   or subranges, nor modify elements in the ranges [first, last) or [d_first, d_first +
   (last - first)). Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

.SH Parameters

   first, last      -      the range of elements to sum
   d_first          -      the beginning of the destination range, may be equal to
                           first
   policy           -      the execution policy to use. See execution policy for
                           details.
   init             -      the initial value
                           unary FunctionObject that will be applied to each element of
   unary_op         -      the input range. The return type must be acceptable as input
                           to binary_op.
   binary_op        -      binary FunctionObject that will be applied in to the result
                           of unary_op, the results of other binary_op, and init.
.SH Type requirements
   -
   InputIt must meet the requirements of InputIterator.
   -
   OutputIt must meet the requirements of OutputIterator.
   -
   ForwardIt1, ForwardIt2 must meet the requirements of ForwardIterator.
   -
   T must meet the requirements of MoveConstructible. All of binary_op(init,
   unary_op(*first)), binary_op(init, init), and binary_op(unary_op(*first),
   unary_op(*first)) must be convertible to T.

.SH Return value

   Iterator to the element past the last element written.

.SH Complexity

   O(last - first) applications of each of binary_op and unary_op.

.SH Exceptions

   The overload with a template parameter named ExecutionPolicy reports errors as
   follows:

     * If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws an exception
       and ExecutionPolicy is one of the three standard policies, std::terminate is
       called. For any other ExecutionPolicy, the behavior is implementation-defined.
     * If the algorithm fails to allocate memory, std::bad_alloc is thrown.

.SH Notes

   unary_op is not applied to init.
