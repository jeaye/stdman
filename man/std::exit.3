.TH std::exit 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstdlib>
   void exit( int exit_code );               \fI(until C++11)\fP
   [[noreturn]] void exit( int exit_code );  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Causes normal program termination to occur.

   Several cleanup steps are performed:

   1) destructors of objects with static storage duration are called in
   reverse order of completion of their constructors or the completion of
   their dynamic initialization, and the functions passed to std::atexit
   are called in reverse order they are registered (last one first).
   a) any static objects whose initialization was completed before the
   call to std::atexit for some function F will be destroyed after the    \fI(until C++11)\fP
   call to F during program termination.
   b) any static objects whose construction began after the call to
   std::atexit for some function F will be destroyed before the call to F
   during program termination (this includes the case where std::atexit
   was called from the constructor of the static object)
   1) The destructors of objects with thread local storage duration, the
   destructors of objects with static storage duration, and the functions
   registered with std::atexit are executed concurrently, while
   maintaining the following guarantees:
   a) The last destructor for thread-local objects is sequenced-before
   the first destructor for a static object
   b) If the completion of the constructor or dynamic initialization for
   thread-local or static object A was sequenced-before thread-local or
   static object B, the completion of the destruction of B is
   sequenced-before the start of the destruction of A
   c) If the completion of the initialization of a static object A was    \fI(since C++11)\fP
   sequenced-before the call to std::atexit for some function F, the call
   to F during termination is sequenced-before the start of the
   destruction of A
   d) If the call to std::atexit for some function F was sequenced-before
   the completion of initialization of a static object A, the start of
   the destruction of A is sequenced-before the call to F during
   termination.
   e) If a call to std::atexit for some function F1 was sequenced-before
   the call to std::atexit for some function F2, then the call to F2
   during termination is sequenced-before the call to F1

     * In the above,

     * if any function registered with atexit or any destructor of static/thread-local
       object throws an exception, std::terminate is called
     * if the compiler opted to lift dynamic initialization of an object to the static
       initialization phase of non-local initialization, the sequencing of destruction
       honors its would-be dynamic initialization.
     * If a function-local (block-scope) static object was destroyed and then that
       function is called from the destructor of another static object and the control
       flow passes through the definition of that object (or if it is used indirectly,
       via pointer or reference), the behavior is undefined.
     * if a function-local (block-scope) static object was initialized during
       construction of a subobject of a class or array, it is only destroyed after all
       subobjects of that class or all elements of that array were destroyed.

   2) all C streams are flushed and closed
   3) files created by std::tmpfile are removed
   4) control is returned to the host environment. If exit_code is 0 or EXIT_SUCCESS,
   an implementation-defined status indicating successful termination is returned. If
   exit_code is EXIT_FAILURE, an implementation-defined status indicating unsuccessful
   termination is returned. In other cases implementation-defined status value is
   returned.

   Stack is not unwound: destructors of variables with automatic storage durations are
   not called.

.SH Relationship with the main function

   Returning from the the main function, either by a return statement or by reaching
   the end of the function performs the normal function termination (calls the
   destructors of the variables with automatic storage durations) and then executes
   std::exit, passing the argument of the return statement (or 0 if implicit return
   was used) as exit_code.

.SH Parameters

   exit_code - exit status of the program

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <cstdlib>

 class Static {
 public:

     ~Static()
     {
         std::cout << "Static dtor\\n";
     }
 };

 class Local {
 public:
     ~Local()
     {
         std::cout << "Local dtor\\n";
     }
 };

 Static static_variable; // dtor of this object *will* be called

 void atexit_handler()
 {
     std::cout << "atexit handler\\n";
 }

 int main()
 {
     Local local_variable; // dtor of this object will *not* be called
     const int result = std::atexit(atexit_handler); // handler will be called

     if (result != 0) {
         std::cerr << "atexit registration failed\\n";
         return EXIT_FAILURE;
     }

     std::cout << "test\\n";
     std::exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
 }

.SH Output:

 test
 atexit handler
 Static dtor
