.SH NAME
std::basic_osyncstream::operator= \- std::basic_osyncstream::operator=

.SH Synopsis
   basic_osyncstream& operator=( std::basic_osyncstream&& other) noexcept;

   Move-assigns a synchronized output stream:

   First, calls emit(). If an exception is thrown by the call to emit(), it is caught
   and ignored.

   Then, move-assigns the wrapped std::basic_syncbuf from the corresponding member of
   other (after this move-assignment, other.get_wrapped() returns a null pointer and
   destruction of other produces no output) and move-assigns the base
   std::basic_ostream (this swaps all stream state variables except for rdbuf between
   *this and other)

.SH Parameters

   other - another osyncstream to move from
