.SH Synopsis
   typedef void (*event_callback)(event type, ios_base& ios, int index);

   The type of function callbacks that can be registered using register_callback() to
   be called on specific events.

   type is a value of type ios_base::event which indicates the type of the event that
   will invoke this callback.

   ios refers to the stream object for which the callback is invoked: *this is passed
   as the argument when callbacks are invoked by std::ios_base and std::basic_ios
   member functions.

   function.
