.SH NAME
std::thread::~thread \- std::thread::~thread

.SH Synopsis
   ~thread();  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Destroys the thread object.

   If *this has an associated thread (joinable() == true), std::terminate() is called.

.SH Notes

   A thread object does not have an associated thread (and is safe to destroy) after

     * it was default-constructed.
     * it was moved from.
     * join() has been called.
     * detach() has been called.

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <thread>
 using namespace std::chrono_literals;

 int main()
 {
     auto bleah = std::thread{[]{ std::this_thread::sleep_for(13ms); }};

 }   // ~thread calls std::terminate()

.SH Possible output:

 terminate called without an active exception
