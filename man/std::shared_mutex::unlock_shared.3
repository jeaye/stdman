.SH NAME
std::shared_mutex::unlock_shared \- std::shared_mutex::unlock_shared

.SH Synopsis
   void unlock_shared();  \fI(since C++17)\fP

   Releases the mutex from shared ownership by the calling thread. . The mutex must be
   locked by the current thread of execution in shared mode, otherwise, the behavior is
   undefined.

   This operation synchronizes-with (as defined in std::memory_order) any subsequent
   lock() operation that obtains ownership of the same mutex.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Exceptions

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Notes

   unlock_shared() is usually not called directly: std::shared_lock is used to manage
   exclusive locking.
