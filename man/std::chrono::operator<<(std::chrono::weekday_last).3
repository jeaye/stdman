   std::chrono::weekday_last& wdl );

   Outputs a textual representation of wdl into the stream os, as if by

   os << std::format(os.getloc(), STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{:L}[last]"),
   wdl.weekday());

   where STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{:L}[last]") is "{:L}[last]" if CharT is char, and
   L"{:L}[last]" if CharT is wchar_t.
