.SH NAME
std::future::valid \- std::future::valid

.SH Synopsis
   bool valid() const;  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Checks if the future refers to a shared state.

   This is the case only for futures that were not default-constructed or moved from
   (i.e. returned by std::promise::get_future(), std::packaged_task::get_future() or
   std::async()) until the first time get() or share() is called.

   The behavior is undefined if any member function other than the destructor, the
   move-assignment operator, or valid is called on a future that does not refer to
   shared state (although implementations are encouraged to throw std::future_error
   indicating no_state in this case). It is valid to move from a future object for
   which valid() is false

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   true if *this refers to a shared state, otherwise false.
