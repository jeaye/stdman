.SH NAME
std::queue::emplace \- std::queue::emplace

.SH Synopsis
   template< class... Args >                  \fI(since C++11)\fP
   void emplace( Args&&... args );            \fI(until C++17)\fP
   template< class... Args >                  \fI(since C++17)\fP
   decltype(auto) emplace( Args&&... args );

   Pushes a new element to the end of the queue. The element is constructed in-place,
   i.e. no copy or move operations are performed. The constructor of the element is
   called with exactly the same arguments as supplied to the function.

   Effectively calls c.emplace_back(std::forward<Args>(args)...);

.SH Parameters

   args - arguments to forward to the constructor of the element

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP                                                                 \fI(until C++17)\fP
   The value or reference, if any, returned by the above call to          \fI(since C++17)\fP
   Container::emplace_back.

.SH Complexity

   Identical to the complexity of Container::emplace_back.
