.SH NAME
std::basic_stringbuf<CharT,Traits,Allocator>::str \- std::basic_stringbuf<CharT,Traits,Allocator>::str

.SH Synopsis
   std::basic_string<CharT, Traits, Allocator> str() const;         \fB(1)\fP
   void str( const std::basic_string<CharT, Traits, Allocator>& s); \fB(2)\fP

   Gets and sets the underlying string.

   1) Creates and returns a std::basic_string object containing a copy of this
   std::basic_stringbuf's underlying character sequence. For input-only streams, the
   returned string contains the characters from the range [eback(), egptr()). For
   input/output or output-only streams, contains the characters from pbase() to the
   last character in the sequence regardless of egptr() and epptr().

   The member character sequence in a buffer open for writing can be
   over-allocated for efficiency purposes. In that case, only the
   initialized characters are returned: these characters are the ones
   that were obtained from the string argument of the constructor, the
   string argument of the most recent call to the second overload of      \fI(since C++11)\fP
   str(), or from an write operation. A typical implementation that uses
   over-allocation maintains a high-watermark pointer to track the end of
   the initialized part of the buffer and this overload returns the
   characters from pbase() to the high-watermark pointer

   2) Deletes the entire underlying character sequence of this std::basic_stringbuf and
   then configures a new underlying character sequence containing a copy of the
   contents of s. The pointers of std::basic_streambuf are initialized as follows:

     * For input streams (mode & ios_base::in == true), eback() points at the first
       character, gptr() == eback(), and egptr() == eback() + s.size(): the subsequent
       input will read the first character copied from s.
     * For output streams (mode & ios_base::out == true), pbase() points at the first
       character and epptr() >= pbase() + s.size() (epptr is allowed to point farther
       so that the following sputc() wouldn't immediately call overflow())

          * For append streams (mode & ios_base::ate == true), pptr() == pbase() +
            s.size(), so that subsequent output will be appended to the last character
            copied from s \fI(since C++11)\fP
          * For non-appending output streams, pptr() == pbase(), so that subsequent
            output will overwrite the characters copied from s.

.SH Parameters

   s - a string object holding the replacement character sequence

.SH Return value

   1) A string object holding a copy of this buffer's underlying character sequence.
   2) \fI(none)\fP

.SH Notes

   This function is typically accessed through std::basic_stringstream::str().

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <sstream>
 #include <iostream>
 int main()
 {
     int n;

     std::istringstream in;  // could also use in("1 2")
     in.rdbuf()->str("1 2"); // set the get area
     in >> n;
     std::cout << "after reading the first int from \\"1 2\\", the int is "
               << n << ", str() = \\"" << in.rdbuf()->str() << "\\"\\n"; // or in.str()

     std::ostringstream out("1 2");
     out << 3;
     std::cout << "after writing the int '3' to output stream \\"1 2\\""
               << ", str() = \\"" << out.str() << "\\"\\n";

     std::ostringstream ate("1 2", std::ios_base::ate); // C++11
     ate << 3;
     std::cout << "after writing the int '3' to append stream \\"1 2\\""
               << ", str() = \\"" << ate.str() << "\\"\\n";
 }

.SH Output:

 after reading the first int from "1 2", the int is 1, str() = "1 2"
 after writing the int '3' to output stream "1 2", str() = "3 2"
 after writing the int '3' to append stream "1 2", str() = "1 23"
