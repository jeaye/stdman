.SH NAME
std::sub_match \- std::sub_match

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <regex>
   template<

   class BidirIt              \fI(since C++11)\fP

   > class sub_match;

   The class template sub_match is used by the regular expression engine to denote
   sequences of characters matched by marked sub-expressions. A match is a [begin, end)
   pair within the target range matched by the regular expression, but with additional
   observer functions to enhance code clarity.

   Only the default constructor is publicly accessible. Instances of sub_match are
   normally constructed and populated as a part of a std::match_results container
   during the processing of one of the regex algorithms.

   The member functions return defined default values unless the matched member is
   true.

   sub_match inherits from std::pair<BidirIt, BidirIt>, although it cannot be treated
   as a std::pair object because member functions such as swap and assignment will not
   work as expected.

.SH Type requirements

   -
   BidirIt must meet the requirements of BidirectionalIterator.

.SH Specializations

   Several specializations for common character sequence types are provided:

   Defined in header <regex>
   Type        Definition
   csub_match  sub_match<const char*>
   wcsub_match sub_match<const wchar_t*>
   ssub_match  sub_match<std::string::const_iterator>
   wssub_match sub_match<std::wstring::const_iterator>

.SH Member types

   Member type     Definition
   iterator        BidirIt
   value_type      std::iterator_traits<BidirIt>::value_type
   difference_type std::iterator_traits<BidirIt>::difference_type
   string_type     std::basic_string<value_type>
