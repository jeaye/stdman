.SH NAME
std::numeric_limits::infinity \- std::numeric_limits::infinity

.SH Synopsis
   static T infinity();            \fI(until C++11)\fP
   static constexpr T infinity();  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Returns the special value "positive infinity", as represented by the floating-point
   type T. Only meaningful if std::numeric_limits<T>::has_infinity == true. In IEEE
   754, the most common binary representation of floating-point numbers, the positive
   infinity is the value with all bits of the exponent set and all bits of the fraction
   cleared.

.SH Return value

   /* non-specialized */ T();

.SH Exceptions

   \fI(none)\fP                    \fI(until C++11)\fP
   noexcept specification:  
   noexcept                  \fI(since C++11)\fP
     

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <limits>
 int main()
 {
     double max = std::numeric_limits<double>::max();
     double inf = std::numeric_limits<double>::infinity();
  
     if(inf > max)
         std::cout << inf << " is greater than " << max << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 inf is greater than 1.79769e+308
