.SH NAME
std::aligned_alloc \- std::aligned_alloc

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstdlib>
   void* aligned_alloc( std::size_t alignment, std::size_t size );  \fI(since C++17)\fP

   Allocate size bytes of uninitialized storage whose alignment is specified by
   alignment. The size parameter must be an integral multiple of alignment.

   The following functions are required to be thread-safe:

     * The library versions of operator new and operator delete
     * User replacement versions of global operator new and operator
       delete
     * std::calloc, std::malloc, std::realloc                             \fI(since C++11)\fP
       , std::aligned_alloc
       \fI(since C++17)\fP, std::free

   Calls to these functions that allocate or deallocate a particular unit
   of storage occur in a single total order, and each such deallocation
   call happens-before the next allocation (if any) in this order.

.SH Parameters

   alignment - specifies the alignment. Must be a valid alignment supported by the
               implementation.
   size      - number of bytes to allocate. An integral multiple of alignment

.SH Return value

   On success, returns the pointer to the beginning of newly allocated memory. To avoid
   a memory leak, the returned pointer must be deallocated with std::free() or
   std::realloc().

   On failure, returns a null pointer.

.SH Notes

   Passing a size which is not an integral multiple of alignment or an alignment which
   is not valid or not supported by the implementation causes the function to fail and
   return a null pointer (C11, as published, specified undefined behavior in this case,
   this was corrected by DR 460).

   As an example of the "supported by the implementation" requirement, POSIX function
   posix_memalign accepts any alignment that is a power of two and a multiple of
   sizeof(void*), and POSIX-based implementations of aligned_alloc inherit this
   requirements.

   Regular std::malloc aligns memory suitable for any object type (which, in practice,
   means that it is aligned to alignof(std::max_align_t)). This function is useful for
   over-aligned allocations, such as to SSE, cache line, or VM page boundary.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <cstdio>
 #include <cstdlib>
  
 int main()
 {
     int* p1 = static_cast<int*>(std::malloc(10*sizeof *p1));
     std::printf("default-aligned address:   %p\\n", static_cast<void*>(p1));
     std::free(p1);
  
     int* p2 = static_cast<int*>(std::aligned_alloc(1024, 1024));
     std::printf("1024-byte aligned address: %p\\n", static_cast<void*>(p2));
     std::free(p2);
 }

.SH Possible output:

 default-aligned address:   0x2221c20
 1024-byte aligned address: 0x2222400
