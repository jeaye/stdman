.TH std::vector::max_size 3 "2019.03.28" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::vector::max_size \- std::vector::max_size

.SH Synopsis
   size_type max_size() const;           \fI(until C++11)\fP
   size_type max_size() const noexcept;  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Returns the maximum number of elements the container is able to hold due to system
   or library implementation limitations, i.e. std::distance(begin(), end()) for the
   largest container.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   Maximum number of elements.

.SH Complexity

   Constant.

.SH Notes

   This value typically reflects the theoretical limit on the size of the container. At
   runtime, the size of the container may be limited to a value smaller than max_size()
   by the amount of RAM available.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <vector>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::vector<char> s;
     std::cout << "Maximum size of a 'vector' is " << s.max_size() << "\\n";
 }

.SH Possible output:

 Maximum size of a 'vector' is 18446744073709551615
