.TH std::vector::max_size 3 "Sep  4 2015" "2.0 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   size_type max_size() const;

   Returns the maximum number of elements the container is able to hold due to system
   or library implementation limitations, i.e. std::distance(begin(), end()) for the
   largest container.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   Maximum number of elements.

.SH Exceptions

   \fI(none)\fP                  \fI(until C++11)\fP
   noexcept specification: \fI(since C++11)\fP
   noexcept

.SH Complexity

   Constant.

.SH Notes

   This value is typically equal to std::numeric_limits<size_type>::max(), and reflects
   the theoretical limit on the size of the container. At runtime, the size of the
   container may be limited to a value smaller than max_size() by the amount of RAM
   available.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <vector>

 int main()
 {
     std::vector<char> s;
     std::cout << "Maximum size of a 'vector' is " << s.max_size() << "\\n";
 }

.SH Possible output:

 Maximum size of a 'vector' is 18446744073709551615
