.SH NAME
std::basic_string::shrink_to_fit \- std::basic_string::shrink_to_fit

.SH Synopsis
   void shrink_to_fit();  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Requests the removal of unused capacity.

   It is a non-binding request to reduce capacity() to size(). It depends on the
   implementation if the request is fulfilled.

   If reallocation takes place, all pointers, references, and iterators are
   invalidated.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Complexity

   Constant

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <string>

 int main()
 {
     std::string s;
     std::cout << "Default-constructed capacity is " << s.capacity() << '\\n';
     s.resize(100);
     std::cout << "Capacity of a 100-element string is " << s.capacity() << '\\n';
     s.clear();
     std::cout << "Capacity after clear() is " << s.capacity() << '\\n';
     s.shrink_to_fit();
     std::cout << "Capacity after shrink_to_fit() is " << s.capacity() << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 Default-constructed capacity is 0
 Capacity of a 100-element string is 100
 Capacity after clear() is 100
 Capacity after shrink_to_fit() is 0
