   Analyzes the character sequence [first,last) for a pattern described below. If no
   characters match the pattern or if the value obtained by parsing the matched
   characters is not representable in the type of value, value is unmodified, otherwise
   the characters matching the pattern are interpreted as a text representation of an
   arithmetic value, which is stored in value.

   1) Integer parsers: Expects the pattern identical to the one used by std::strtol in
   the default ("C") locale and the given non-zero numeric base, except that

     * "0x" or "0X" prefixes are not recognized for base 16
     * only the minus sign is recognized (not the plus sign), and only for signed
       integer types of value.

   The library provides overloads for all signed and unsigned integer types and char as
   the referenced type of the parameter value.
   2-4) Floating-point parsers: Expects the pattern identical to the one used by
   std::strtod in the default ("C") locale, except that

     * the plus sign is not recognized outside of the exponent (only the minus sign is
       permitted at the beginning)
     * if fmt has std::chars_format::scientific set but not std::chars_format::fixed,
       the exponent part is required (otherwise it is optional)
     * if fmt has std::chars_format::fixed set but not std::chars_format::scientific,
       the optional exponent is not permitted
     * if fmt is std::chars_format::hex, the prefix "0x" or "0X" is not permitted (the
       string "0x123" parses as the value "0" with unparsed remainder "x123").

   In any case, the resulting value is one of at most two floating-point values closest
   to the value of the string matching the pattern, after rounding according to
   std::round_to_nearest.
   5) The return type (see Return value below)

.SH Parameters

   first, last - valid character range to parse
   value       - the out-parameter where the parsed value is stored if successful
   base        - integer base to use: a value between 2 and 36 (inclusive).
   fmt         - floating-point formatting to use, a bitmask of type std::chars_format

.SH Return value

   On success, returns a value of type from_chars_result such that ptr points at the
   first character not matching the pattern, or has the value equal to last if all
   characters match and ec is value-initialized.

   If there is no pattern match, returns a value of type from_chars_result such that
   ptr equals first and ec equals std::errc::invalid_argument. value is unmodified.

   If the pattern was matched, but the parsed value is not in the range representable
   by the type of value, returns value of type from_chars_result such that ec equals
   std::errc::result_out_of_range and ptr points at the first character not matching
   the pattern. value is unmodified.

.SH Exceptions

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Notes

   Unlike other parsing functions in C++ and C libraries, std::from_chars is
   locale-independent, non-allocating, and non-throwing. Only a small subset of parsing
   policies used by other libraries (such as std::sscanf) is provided. This is intended
   to allow the fastest possible implementation that is useful in common
   high-throughput contexts such as text-based interchange (JSON or XML).

   The guarantee that std::from_chars can recover every floating-point value formatted
   by std::to_chars exactly is only provided if both functions are from the same
   implementation.

   A pattern consisting of a sign with no digits following it is treated as pattern
   that did not match anything.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <charconv>
 #include <array>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::array<char, 10> str{"42"};
     int result;
     if(auto [p, ec] = std::from_chars(str.data(), str.data()+str.size(), result);
        ec == std::errc())
         std::cout << result;
 }

.SH Output:

 42
