.TH std::cerr,std::wcerr 3 "2024.06.10" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::cerr,std::wcerr \- std::cerr,std::wcerr

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <iostream>
   extern std::ostream cerr;    \fB(1)\fP
   extern std::wostream wcerr;  \fB(2)\fP

   The global objects std::cerr and std::wcerr control output to a stream buffer of
   implementation-defined type (derived from std::streambuf and std::wstreambuf,
   respectively), associated with the standard C error output stream stderr.

   These objects are guaranteed to be initialized during or before the first time an
   object of type std::ios_base::Init is constructed and are available for use in the
   constructors and destructors of static objects with ordered initialization (as long
   as <iostream> is included before the object is defined).

   Unless std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) has been issued, it is safe to
   concurrently access these objects from multiple threads for both formatted and
   unformatted output.

   Once initialized, (std::cerr.flags() & unitbuf) != 0 (same for std::wcerr) meaning
   that any output sent to these stream objects is immediately flushed to the OS (via
   std::basic_ostream::sentry's destructor).

   In addition, std::cerr.tie() returns &std::cout (same for std::wcerr and
   std::wcout), meaning that any output operation on std::cerr first executes
   std::cout.flush() (via std::basic_ostream::sentry's constructor).

.SH Notes

   The 'c' in the name refers to "character" (stroustrup.com FAQ); cerr means
   "character error (stream)" and wcerr means "wide character error (stream)".

.SH Example

   Output to stderr via std::cerr flushes out the pending output on std::cout, while
   output to stderr via std::clog does not.


// Run this code

 #include <chrono>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <thread>
 using namespace std::chrono_literals;

 void f()
 {
     std::cout << "Output from thread...";
     std::this_thread::sleep_for(2s);
     std::cout << "...thread calls flush()" << std::endl;
 }

 int main()
 {
     std::jthread t1{f};
     std::this_thread::sleep_for(1000ms);
     std::clog << "This output from main is not tie()'d to cout\\n";
     std::cerr << "This output is tie()'d to cout\\n";
 }

.SH Possible output:

 This output from main is not tie()'d to cout
 Output from thread...This output is tie()'d to cout
 ...thread calls flush()
