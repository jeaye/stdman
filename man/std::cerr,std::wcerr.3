.TH std::cerr,std::wcerr 3 "2017.04.02" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::cerr,std::wcerr \- std::cerr,std::wcerr

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <iostream>
   extern std::ostream cerr;    \fB(1)\fP
   extern std::wostream wcerr;  \fB(2)\fP

   The global objects std::cerr and std::wcerr control output to a stream buffer of
   implementation-defined type (derived from std::streambuf and std::wstreambuf,
   respectively), associated with the standard C error output stream stderr.

   These objects are guaranteed to be initialized during or before the first time an
   object of type std::ios_base::Init is constructed and are available for use in the
   constructors and destructors of static objects with ordered initialization (as long
   as <iostream> is included before the object is defined).

   Unless sync_with_stdio(false) has been issued, it is safe to concurrently access
   these objects from multiple threads for both formatted and unformatted output.

   Once initialized, (std::cerr.flags() & unitbuf) != 0 (same for wcerr) meaning that
   any output sent to these stream objects is immediately flushed to the OS (via
   std::basic_ostream::sentry's destructor).

   In addition, std::cerr.tie() returns &std::cout (same for wcerr and wcout), meaning
   that any output operation on std::cerr first executes std::cout.flush() (via
   std::basic_ostream::sentry's constructor) \fI(since C++11)\fP

.SH Notes

   The 'c' in the name refers to "character" (stroustrup.com FAQ); cerr means
   "character error (stream)" and wcerr means "wide character error (stream)"

.SH Example

   output to stderr via cerr flushes out the pending output on cout, while output to
   stderr via clog does not

   
// Run this code

 #include <thread>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <chrono>
 void f()
 {
     std::cout << "Output from thread...";
     std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(2));
     std::cout << "...thread calls flush()" << std::endl;
 }
  
 int main()
 {
     std::thread t1(f);
     std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
     std::clog << "This output from main is not tie()'d to cout\\n";
     std::cerr << "This output is tie()'d to cout\\n";
     t1.join();
 }

.SH Output:

 This output from main is not tie()'d to cout
 Output from thread...This output is tie()'d to cout
 ...thread calls flush()
