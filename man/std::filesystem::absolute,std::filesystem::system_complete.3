.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <filesystem>
   path absolute( const std::filesystem::path& p,
                  const std::filesystem::path& base =                 \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   std::filesystem::current_path() );
   path system_complete(const std::filesystem::path& p);
   path system_complete(const std::filesystem::path& p,               \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   std::error_code& ec);

   1) Returns absolute path of p relative to base according to the following rules:

     * If p has both root name and root directory (e.g. "C:\\users", then the path is
       returned, unmodified.
     * If p has a root name not followed by a root directory (e.g. "C:text.txt"), then
       base is inserted between p's root name and the remainder of p. Formally,
       p.root_name() / absolute(base).root_directory() / absolute(base).relative_path()
       / p.relative_path() is returned,
     * If p has no root name, but has a root directory (e.g. "/var/tmp/file.txt" on a
       POSIX system or "\\users\\ABC\\Document.doc" on Windows), then the root name of
       base, if it has one, is prepended to p (on a POSIX system, p is not modified, on
       a Windows system, "\\users\\ABC\\Document.doc" becomes "C:\\users\\ABC\\Document.doc".
       Formally, absolute(base).root_name() / p is returned.
     * If p has no root name and no root directory (e.g. "../file.txt", then the entire
       base is prepended to p. Formally, absolute(base) / p is returned.

   2) Obtains the absolute path that identifies the file that the OS file opening API
   would access given the pathname p. On POSIX systems, this is equivalent to \fB(1)\fP with
   the default base (current_path()). On Windows systems, each logical drive has its
   own current working directory, and so if p is not already absolute and has a root
   name component (e.g. "E:filename.txt", that drive's current working directory is
   used, which may have been set by an earlier executed program.

.SH Parameters

   p    - path to convert to absolute form
   base - path (not necessarily absolute) to serve as the starting location
   ec   - out-parameter for error reporting in the non-throwing overload

.SH Return value

   Returns an absolute (although not necessarily canonical) path formed by combining p
   and base as described above.

.SH Exceptions

   The overload that does not take a std::error_code& parameter throws filesystem_error
   on underlying OS API errors, constructed with p as the first argument, base as the
   second argument, and the OS error code as the error code argument. std::bad_alloc
   may be thrown if memory allocation fails. The overload taking a std::error_code&
   parameter sets it to the OS API error code if an OS API call fails, and executes
   ec.clear() if no errors occur. This overload has
   noexcept specification:  
   noexcept
     

.SH Notes

   On systems that support root names (e.g. Windows), the result of calling absolute on
   a relative path that has a root name (e.g. "D:file.txt" when the root name of base
   is different will usually result in a non-existent path.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <filesystem>
 namespace fs = std::filesystem;
 int main()
 {
     fs::path p = "C:cl.exe";
     std::cout << "Current path is " << fs::current_path() << '\\n'
               << "Absolute path for " << p << " is " << fs::absolute(p) << '\\n'
               << "System complete path for " << p << " is " << fs::system_complete(p) << '\\n';
 }

.SH Possible output:

 Current path is "D:/local/ConsoleApplication1"
 Absolute path for "C:cl.exe" is "C:/local/ConsoleApplication1/cl.exe"
 System complete path for "C:cl.exe" is "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\\VC\\bin\\cl.exe"
