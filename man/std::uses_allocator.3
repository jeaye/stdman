std::uses_allocator \- std::uses_allocator

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <memory>
   template< class T, class Alloc > struct uses_allocator;  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   If T has a member typedef allocator_type which is convertible from Alloc
   or is an alias of std::experimental::erased_type
   (library fundamentals TS), the member constant value is true. Otherwise value is
   false.

  Helper variable template

   template< class T, class Alloc >
   inline constexpr bool uses_allocator_v = uses_allocator<T,             \fI(since C++17)\fP
   Alloc>::value;

Inherited from std::integral_constant

  Uses-allocator construction

   There are three conventions of passing an allocator alloc to a constructor of some
   type T:

     * if T does not use a compatible allocator (std::uses_allocator_v<T, Alloc> is
       false), then alloc is ignored.
     * otherwise, std::uses_allocator_v<T, Alloc> is true, and

     * if T uses the leading-allocator convention (is invocable as
       T(std::allocator_arg, alloc, args...)), then uses-allocator construction uses
       this form
     * if T uses the trailing-allocator convention (is invocable as T(args..., alloc)),
       then uses-allocator construction uses this form
     * otherwise, the program is ill-formed (this means std::uses_allocator_v<T, Alloc>
       is true, but the type does not follow either of the two allowed conventions)

     * As a special case, std::pair is treated as a uses-allocator type even though
       std::uses_allocator is false for pairs (unlike e.g. std::tuple): see
       pair-specific overloads of
       std::polymoprhic_allocator::construct and
       std::scoped_allocator_adaptor::construct
       \fI(until C++20)\fP
       std::uses_allocator_construction_args
       \fI(since C++20)\fP

   The utility functions std::make_obj_using_allocator, and
   std::uninitialized_construct_using_allocator may be used to explicitly
   create an object following the above protocol, and                     \fI(since C++20)\fP
   std::uses_allocator_construction_args can be used to prepare the
   argument list that matches the flavor of uses-allocator construction
   expected by the type.

.SH Specializations

   Custom specializations of the type trait std::uses_allocator are allowed for types
   that do not have the member typedef allocator_type but satisfy one of the following
   two requirements:

   1) T has a constructor which takes std::allocator_arg_t as the first argument, and
   Alloc as the second argument.
   2) T has a constructor which takes Alloc as the last argument.

   In the above, Alloc is a type that satisfies Allocator
   or is a pointer type convertible to std::experimental::pmr::memory_resource*
   (library fundamentals TS).

   The following specializations are already provided by the standard library:

.SH Notes

   This type trait is used by std::tuple, std::scoped_allocator_adaptor, and
   std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator. It may also be used by custom allocators or wrapper
   types to determine whether the object or member being constructed is itself capable
   of using an allocator (e.g. is a container), in which case an allocator should be
   passed to its constructor.
