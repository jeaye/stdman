std::uses_allocator \- std::uses_allocator

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <memory>
   template< class T, class Alloc >  \fI(since C++11)\fP
   struct uses_allocator

   If T has a member typedef allocator_type which is convertible from Alloc
   or is an alias of std::experimental::erased_type
   (library fundamentals TS), provides the member constant value equal to true.
   Otherwise value is false.

.SH Member constants

   value    true if T uses allocator Alloc, false otherwise
   \fB[static]\fP \fI(public static member constant)\fP

.SH Member functions

   operator bool converts the object to bool, returns value
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
   operator()    returns value
   \fI(C++14)\fP       \fI(public member function)\fP

.SH Member types

   Type       Definition
   value_type bool
   type       std::integral_constant<bool, value>

.SH Specializations

   Custom specializations of the type trait std::uses_allocator are allowed for types
   that do not have the member typedef allocator_type but satisfy one of the following
   two requirements:

   1) T has a constructor which takes std::allocator_arg_t as the first argument, and
   Alloc as the second argument.
   2) T has a constructor which takes Alloc as the last argument.

   In the above, Alloc is a type that satisfies Allocator
   or is a pointer type convertible to std::experimental::pmr::memory_resource*
   (library fundamentals TS).

   The following specializations are already provided by the standard library:

.SH Notes

   This type trait is used by std::scoped_allocator_adaptor and std::tuple. It may also
   be used by custom allocators or wrapper types to determine whether the object or
   member being constructed is itself capable of using an allocator (e.g. is a
   container), in which case an allocator should be passed to its constructor.
