.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <locale>
   public:                                                                        \fB(1)\fP
   string_type transform( const CharT* low, const CharT* high ) const;
   protected:                                                                     \fB(2)\fP
   virtual string_type do_transform( const CharT* low, const CharT* high ) const;

   1) Public member function, calls the protected virtual member function do_transform
   of the most derived class.
   2) Converts the character sequence [low, high) to a string that, compared
   lexicographically (e.g. with operator< for strings) with the result of calling
   transform() on another string, produces the same result as calling do_compare() on
   the same two strings.

.SH Parameters

   low  - pointer to the first character in the sequence to transform
   high - one past the end pointer for the sequence to transform

.SH Return value

   The string transformed so that lexicographic comparison of the transformed strings
   may be used instead of collating of the originals. In the "C" locale, the returned
   string is the exact copy of [low, high). In other locales, the contents of the
   returned string are implementation-defined, and the size may be considerably longer.

.SH Notes

   In addition to the the use in collation, the implementation-specific format of the
   transformed string is known to std::regex_traits<>::transform_primary, which is able
   to extract the equivalence class information.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <iomanip>
 #include <locale>

 int main()
 {
     std::locale::global(std::locale("sv_SE.utf8"));
     auto& f = std::use_facet<std::collate<wchar_t>>(std::locale());

     std::wstring in1 = L"\\u00e4ngel";
     std::wstring in2 = L"\\u00e5r";

     std::wstring out1 = f.transform(&in1[0], &in1[0] + in1.size());
     std::wstring out2 = f.transform(&in2[0], &in2[0] + in2.size());

     std::wcout << "In the Swedish locale: ";
     if(out1 < out2)
          std::wcout << in1 << " before " << in2 << '\\n';
     else
          std::wcout << in2 << " before " << in1 << '\\n';

     std::wcout << "In lexicographic comparison: ";
     if(in1 < in2)
          std::wcout << in1 << " before " << in2 << '\\n';
     else
          std::wcout << in2 << " before " << in1 << '\\n';

 }

.SH Output:

 In the Swedish locale: år before ängel
 In lexicographic comparison: ängel before år
