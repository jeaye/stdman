.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <locale>
   class money_base;

   The class std::money_base provides constants which are inherited and used by the
   std::moneypunct, std::money_get and std::money_put facets.

.SH Member types

   Member type                                     Definition
   enum part { none, space, symbol, sign, value }; unscoped enumeration type
   struct pattern { char field[4]; };              the monetary format type

   Enumeration constant Definition
   none                 whitespace is permitted but not required except in the last
                        position, where whitespace is not permitted
   space                one or more whitespace characters are required
   symbol               the sequence of characters returned by moneypunct::curr_symbol
                        is required
                        the first of the characters returned by
   sign                 moneypunct::positive_sign or moneypunct::negative_sign is
                        required
   value                the absolute numeric monetary value is required

.SH Notes

   The monetary format is an array of four chars convertible to std::money_base::part.
   In that sequence, each of symbol, sign, and value appears exactly once, and either
   space or none appears in the remaining position. The value none, if present, is not
   first; the value space, if present, is neither first nor last.

   The default format, returned by the standard specializations of std::moneypunct is
   {symbol, sign, none, value}
