.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <semaphore>
   template<std::ptrdiff_t LeastMaxValue = /* implementation-defined
   */>                                                                \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++20)\fP
   class counting_semaphore;
   using binary_semaphore = std::counting_semaphore<1>;               \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++20)\fP

   1) A counting_semaphore is a lightweight synchronization primitive that can control
   access to a shared resource. Unlike a std::mutex, a counting_semaphore allows more
   than one concurrent access to the same resource, for at least LeastMaxValue
   concurrent accessors. The program is ill-formed if LeastMaxValue is negative.
   2) binary_semaphore is an alias for specialization of std::counting_semaphore with
   LeastMaxValue being 1. Implementations may implement binary_semaphore more
   efficiently than the default implementation of std::counting_semaphore.

   A counting_semaphore contains an internal counter initialized by the constructor.
   This counter is decremented by calls to acquire() and related methods, and is
   incremented by calls to release(). When the counter is zero, acquire() blocks until
   the counter is incremented, but try_acquire() does not block; try_acquire_for() and
   try_acquire_until() block until the counter is incremented or a timeout is reached.

   Similar to std::condition_variable::wait(), counting_semaphore's try_acquire() can
   spuriously fail.

   Specializations of std::counting_semaphore are not DefaultConstructible,
   CopyConstructible, MoveConstructible, CopyAssignable, or MoveAssignable.

.SH Notes

   As its name indicates, the LeastMaxValue is the minimum max value, not the actual
   max value. Thus max() can yield a number larger than LeastMaxValue.

   Unlike std::mutex a counting_semaphore is not tied to threads of execution -
   acquiring a semaphore can occur on a different thread than releasing the semaphore,
   for example. All operations on counting_semaphore can be performed concurrently and
   without any relation to specific threads of execution, with the exception of the
   destructor which cannot be performed concurrently but can be performed on a
   different thread.

   Semaphores are also often used for the semantics of signalling/notifying rather than
   mutual exclusion, by initializing the semaphore with 0 and thus blocking the
   receiver(s) that try to acquire(), until the notifier "signals" by invoking
   release(n). In this respect semaphores can be considered alternatives to
   std::condition_variables, often with better performance.

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <thread>
 #include <chrono>
 #include <semaphore>


 // global binary semaphore instances
 // object counts are set to zero
 // objects are in non-signaled state
 std::binary_semaphore
         smphSignalMainToThread{0},
         smphSignalThreadToMain{0};

 void ThreadProc()
 {
         // wait for a signal from the main proc
         // by attempting to decrement the semaphore
         smphSignalMainToThread.acquire();

         // this call blocks until the semaphore's count
         // is increased from the main proc

         std::cout << "[thread] Got the signal\\n"; // response message

         // wait for 3 seconds to imitate some work
         // being done by the thread
         using namespace std::literals;
         std::this_thread::sleep_for(3s);

         std::cout << "[thread] Send the signal\\n"; // message

         // signal the main proc back
         smphSignalThreadToMain.release();
 }

 int main()
 {
         // create some worker thread
         std::thread thrWorker(ThreadProc);

         std::cout << "[main] Send the signal\\n"; // message

         // signal the worker thread to start working
         // by increasing the semaphore's count
         smphSignalMainToThread.release();

         // wait until the worker thread is done doing the work
         // by attempting to decrement the semaphore's count
         smphSignalThreadToMain.acquire();

         std::cout << "[main] Got the signal\\n"; // response message
         thrWorker.join();
 }

.SH Output:

 [main] Send the signal
 [thread] Got the signal
 [thread] Send the signal
 [main] Got the signal
