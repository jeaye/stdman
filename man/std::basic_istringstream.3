   > class basic_istringstream;

   The class template std::basic_istringstream implements input operations on memory
   (std::basic_string) based streams. It essentially wraps a raw string device
   implementation (std::basic_stringbuf) into a higher-level interface
   (std::basic_istream). The complete interface to unique std::basic_stringbuf members
   is provided.
