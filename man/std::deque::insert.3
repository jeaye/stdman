   Inserts elements at the specified location in the container.

   1-2) inserts value before pos
   3) inserts count copies of the value before pos
   4) inserts elements from range [first, last) before pos.

   This overload has the same effect as overload \fB(3)\fP if InputIt is an     \fI(until C++11)\fP
   integral type.
   This overload only participates in overload resolution if InputIt      \fI(since C++11)\fP
   qualifies as InputIterator, to avoid ambiguity with the overload \fB(3)\fP.

   The behavior is undefined if first and last are iterators into *this.
   5) inserts elements from initializer list ilist before pos.

   All iterators, including the past-the-end iterator, are invalidated. References are
   invalidated too, unless pos == begin() or pos == end(), in which case they are not
   invalidated.

.SH Parameters

   pos                  -          iterator before which the content will be inserted.
                                   pos may be the end() iterator
   value                -          element value to insert
   first, last          -          the range of elements to insert, can't be iterators
                                   into container for which insert is called
   ilist                -          initializer list to insert the values from
.SH Type requirements
   -
   T must meet the requirements of CopyAssignable and CopyInsertable in order to use
   overload \fB(1)\fP.
   -
   T must meet the requirements of MoveAssignable and MoveInsertable in order to use
   overload \fB(2)\fP.
   -
   T must meet the requirements of CopyAssignable and CopyInsertable in order to use
   overload \fB(3)\fP.
   -
   T must meet the requirements of EmplaceConstructible in order to use overload (4,5).
   -
   T must meet the requirements of Swappable, MoveAssignable, MoveConstructible and
   MoveInsertable in order to use overload (4,5). \fI(since C++17)\fP

.SH Return value

   1-2) Iterator pointing to the inserted value
   3) Iterator pointing to the first element inserted, or pos if count==0.
   4) Iterator pointing to the first element inserted, or pos if first==last.
   5) Iterator pointing to the first element inserted, or pos if ilist is empty.

.SH Complexity

   1-2) Constant plus linear in the lesser of the distances between pos and either of
   the ends of the container.
   3) Linear in count plus linear in the lesser of the distances between pos and either
   of the ends of the container.
   4) Linear in std::distance(first, last) plus linear in the lesser of the distances
   between pos and either of the ends of the container.
   5) Linear in ilist.size() plus linear in the lesser of the distances between pos and
   either of the ends of the container.

.SH Exceptions

   If an exception is thrown when inserting a single element at either end, this
   function has no effect \fI(strong exception guarantee)\fP.
