   BidirIt middle, BidirIt last, Compare comp );

   Merges two consecutive sorted ranges [first, middle) and [middle, last) into one
   sorted range [first, last). For equivalent elements in the original two ranges, the
   elements from the first range (preserving their original order) precede the elements
   from the second range (preserving their original order).

   1) Elements are compared using operator< and the ranges must be sorted with respect
   to the same.
   3) Elements are compared using the given binary comparison function comp and the
   ranges must be sorted with respect to the same.
   2,4) Same as (1,3), but executed according to policy. These overloads do not
   participate in overload resolution unless
   std::is_execution_policy_v<std::decay_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true

.SH Parameters

   first    -  the beginning of the first sorted range
   middle   -  the end of the first sorted range and the beginning of the second
   last     -  the end of the second sorted range
   policy   -  the execution policy to use. See execution policy for details.
               comparison function object (i.e. an object that satisfies the
               requirements of Compare) which returnstrue if the first argument is
               less than (i.e. is ordered before) the second.

               The signature of the comparison function should be equivalent to the
               following:

                bool cmp(const Type1 &a, const Type2 &b);
   comp     -
               While the signature does not need to have const &, the function must not
               modify the objects passed to it and must be able to accept all values of
               type (possibly const) Type1 and Type2 regardless of value category
               (thus, Type1 & is not allowed
               , nor is Type1 unless for Type1 a move is equivalent to a copy
               \fI(since C++11)\fP).
               The types Type1 and Type2 must be such that an object of type BidirIt
               can be dereferenced and then implicitly converted to both of them.
.SH Type requirements
   -
   BidirIt must meet the requirements of ValueSwappable and
   LegacyBidirectionalIterator.
   -
   The type of dereferenced BidirIt must meet the requirements of MoveAssignable and
   MoveConstructible.

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Complexity

   Given N = std::distance(first, last)},

   1,3) Exactly N-1 comparisons if enough additional memory is available. If the memory
   is insufficient, O(N log N) comparisons.
   2,4) O(N log N) comparisons.

.SH Exceptions

   The overloads with a template parameter named ExecutionPolicy report errors as
   follows:

     * If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws an exception
       and ExecutionPolicy is one of the standard policies, std::terminate is called.
       For any other ExecutionPolicy, the behavior is implementation-defined.
     * If the algorithm fails to allocate memory, std::bad_alloc is thrown.

.SH Notes

   This function attempts to allocate a temporary buffer. If the allocation fails, the
   less efficient algorithm is chosen.

.SH Example

   The following code is an implementation of merge sort.

   
// Run this code

 #include <vector>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <algorithm>
  
 template<class Iter>
 void merge_sort(Iter first, Iter last)
 {
     if (last - first > 1) {
         Iter middle = first + (last - first) / 2;
         merge_sort(first, middle);
         merge_sort(middle, last);
         std::inplace_merge(first, middle, last);
     }
 }
  
 int main()
 {
     std::vector<int> v{8, 2, -2, 0, 11, 11, 1, 7, 3};
     merge_sort(v.begin(), v.end());
     for(auto n : v) {
         std::cout << n << ' ';
     }
     std::cout << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 -2 0 1 2 3 7 8 11 11
