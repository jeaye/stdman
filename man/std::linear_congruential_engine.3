.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <random>
   template<

   class UIntType,

   > class linear_congruential_engine;

   linear_congruential_engine is a random number engine based on Linear congruential
   generator (LCG). A LCG has a state that consists of a single integer.

   The transition algorithm of the LCG function is \\(\\small{x_{i+1}\\leftarrow(a x_i +
   c)\\mod m}\\)x
   i+1 ← (ax
   i+c) mod m.

   The following typedefs define the random number engine with two commonly used
   parameter sets:

                       Discovered in 1969 by Lewis, Goodman and Miller, adopted as
                       "Minimal standard" in 1988 by Park and Miller
                       std::linear_congruential_engine<std::uint_fast32_t, 48271, 0,
                       2147483647>
   minstd_rand\fI(C++11)\fP
                       Newer "Minimum standard", recommended by Park, Miller, and
                       Stockmeyer in 1993

.SH Template parameters

              The result type generated by the generator. The effect is undefined if
   UIntType - this is not one of unsigned short, unsigned int, unsigned long, or
              unsigned long long.
   a        - the multiplier term
   c        - the increment term
   m        - the modulus term

.SH Member types

   Member type        Definition
   result_type\fI(C++11)\fP The integral type generated by the engine. Results are undefined
                      if this is not an unsigned integral type.
