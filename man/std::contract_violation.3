.SH NAME
std::contract_violation \- std::contract_violation

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <contract>
   class contract_violation;     \fI(since C++20)\fP

   The class contract_violation describes information about a contract violation. It is
   generated by a C++ implementation and passed to a contract violation handler when a
   contract violation is detected.

.SH Member functions

   line_number     returns the line number where the contract violation happened
                   \fI(public member function)\fP
   file_name       returns the name of the file where the contract violation happened
                   \fI(public member function)\fP
                   returns the name of the function where the contract violation
   function_name   happened
                   \fI(public member function)\fP
   comment         returns a string describing the predicate of the violated contract
                   \fI(public member function)\fP
                   returns a string describing the assertion level of the violated
   assertion_level contract
                   \fI(public member function)\fP

std::contract_violation::line_number

   std::uint_least32_t line_number() const noexcept;

   Returns the location of the source code where the contract violation happened. If
   the name is unknown, an implementation may return 0 instead.

std::contract_violation::file_name

   std::string_view file_name() const noexcept;

   Returns the name of the the source file where the contract violation happened. If
   the name is unknown, an implementation may return an empty string_view instead.

std::contract_violation::function_name

   std::string_view function_name() const noexcept;

   Returns the name of the function where the contract violation happened. If the name
   is unknown, an implementation may return an empty string_view instead.

std::contract_violation::comment

   std::string_view comment() const noexcept;

   Returns an implementation-defined string describing the predicate of the violated
   contract.

std::contract_violation::assertion_level

   std::string_view assertion_level() const noexcept;

   Returns a string describing the assertion level of the violated contract.
