   Defined in header <locale>
   template<

   class InternT,
   class ExternT,
   class State

   > class codecvt;

   Class std::codecvt encapsulates conversion of character strings, including wide and
   multibyte, from one encoding to another. All file I/O operations performed through
   std::basic_fstream<CharT> use the std::codecvt<CharT, char, std::mbstate_t> facet of
   the locale imbued in the stream.

   The following standalone (locale-independent) specializations are provided by the
   standard library:

   Defined in header <locale>
   std::codecvt<char, char, std::mbstate_t> identity conversion
   std::codecvt<char16_t, char,             conversion between UTF-16 and UTF-8 (since
   std::mbstate_t>                          C++11)(deprecated in C++20)
   std::codecvt<char16_t, char8_t,          conversion between UTF-16 and UTF-8 (since
   std::mbstate_t>                          C++20)
   std::codecvt<char32_t, char,             conversion between UTF-32 and UTF-8 (since
   std::mbstate_t>                          C++11)(deprecated in C++20)
   std::codecvt<char32_t, char8_t,          conversion between UTF-32 and UTF-8 (since
   std::mbstate_t>                          C++20)
   std::codecvt<wchar_t, char,              conversion between the system's native wide
   std::mbstate_t>                          and the single-byte narrow character sets

   In addition, every locale object constructed in a C++ program implements its own
   (locale-specific) versions of these four specializations.

.SH Protected member functions

   do_out           converts a string from internT to externT, such as when writing to
   \fB[virtual]\fP        file
                    \fI(virtual protected member function)\fP
   do_in            converts a string from externT to internT, such as when reading
   \fB[virtual]\fP        from file
                    \fI(virtual protected member function)\fP
   do_unshift       generates the termination character sequence of externT characters
   \fB[virtual]\fP        for incomplete conversion
                    \fI(virtual protected member function)\fP
   do_encoding      returns the number of externT characters necessary to produce one
   \fB[virtual]\fP        internT character, if constant
                    \fI(virtual protected member function)\fP
   do_always_noconv tests if the facet encodes an identity conversion for all valid
   \fB[virtual]\fP        argument values
                    \fI(virtual protected member function)\fP
   do_length        calculates the length of the externT string that would be consumed

                    \fI(virtual protected member function)\fP
   do_max_length    returns the maximum number of externT characters that could be

   Member type                                 Definition
   enum result { ok, partial, error, noconv }; Unscoped enumeration type

   Enumeration constant Definition
   ok                   conversion was completed with no error
   partial              not all source characters were converted
   error                encountered an invalid character
   noconv               no conversion required, input and output types are the same

.SH Example

   The following examples reads a UTF-8 file using a locale which implements UTF-8
   conversion in codecvt<wchar_t, char, mbstate_t> and converts a UTF-8 string to
   UTF-16 using one of the standard specializations of std::codecvt

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <fstream>
 #include <string>
 #include <locale>
 #include <iomanip>
 #include <codecvt>

 // utility wrapper to adapt locale-bound facets for wstring/wbuffer convert
 template<class Facet>
 struct deletable_facet : Facet
 {
     template<class ...Args>
     deletable_facet(Args&& ...args) : Facet(std::forward<Args>(args)...) {}
     ~deletable_facet() {}
 };

 int main()
 {
     // UTF-8 narrow multibyte encoding
     std::string data = u8"z\\u00df\\u6c34\\U0001f34c";
                        // or u8"zß水🍌"
                        // or "\\x7a\\xc3\\x9f\\xe6\\xb0\\xb4\\xf0\\x9f\\x8d\\x8c";

     std::ofstream("text.txt") << data;

     // using system-supplied locale's codecvt facet
     std::wifstream fin("text.txt");
     // reading from wifstream will use codecvt<wchar_t, char, mbstate_t>
     // this locale's codecvt converts UTF-8 to UCS4 (on systems such as Linux)
     fin.imbue(std::locale("en_US.UTF-8"));
     std::cout << "The UTF-8 file contains the following UCS4 code points: \\n";
     for (wchar_t c; fin >> c; )
         std::cout << "U+" << std::hex << std::setw(4) << std::setfill('0') << c << '\\n';

     // using standard (locale-independent) codecvt facet
     std::wstring_convert<
         deletable_facet<std::codecvt<char16_t, char, std::mbstate_t>>, char16_t> conv16;
     std::u16string str16 = conv16.from_bytes(data);

     std::cout << "The UTF-8 file contains the following UTF-16 code points: \\n";
     for (char16_t c : str16)
         std::cout << "U+" << std::hex << std::setw(4) << std::setfill('0') << c << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 The UTF-8 file contains the following UCS4 code points:
 U+007a
 U+00df
 U+6c34
 U+1f34c
 The UTF-8 file contains the following UTF-16 code points:
 U+007a
 U+00df
 U+6c34
 U+d83c
 U+df4c
