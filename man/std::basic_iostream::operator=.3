.SH Synopsis
   basic_iostream& operator=( const basic_iostream& other ) = delete; \fB(1)\fP
   protected:                                                         \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   basic_iostream& operator=( basic_iostream&& other );

   Assigns another stream object.

   1) Copy assignment is not allowed.
   2) Move assigns another stream object. Effectively calls swap(rhs). This move
   assignment operator is protected: it is called by the move assignment operators of
   the derived stream classes std::basic_stringstream and std::basic_fstream which know
   how to properly move-assign the associated stream buffers.

.SH Parameters

   other - another stream to assign state of

.SH Return value
