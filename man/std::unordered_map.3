   Unordered map is an associative container that contains key-value pairs with unique
   keys. Search, insertion, and removal of elements have average constant-time
   complexity.

   Internally, the elements are not sorted in any particular order, but organized into
   buckets. Which bucket an element is placed into depends entirely on the hash of its
   key. This allows fast access to individual elements, since once the hash is
   computed, it refers to the exact bucket the element is placed into.

   std::unordered_map meets the requirements of Container, AllocatorAwareContainer,
   UnorderedAssociativeContainer.

  Iterator invalidation

                  Operations                        Invalidated
   All read only operations, swap, std::swap Never
   clear, rehash, reserve, operator=         Always
   insert, emplace, emplace_hint, operator[] Only if causes rehash
   erase                                     Only to the element erased

.SH Notes

     * The swap functions do not invalidate any of the iterators inside the container,
       but they do invalidate the iterator marking the end of the swap region.

     * References and pointers to either key or data stored in the container are only
       invalidated by erasing that element, even when the corresponding iterator is
       invalidated.

         {"GREEN","#00FF00"},
         {"BLUE","#0000FF"}

     // Iterate and print keys and values of unordered_map
     for( const auto& n : u ) {

     // Add two new entries to the unordered_map
     u["BLACK"] = "#000000";
     u["WHITE"] = "#FFFFFF";

     // Output values by key
     std::cout << "The HEX of color RED is:[" << u["RED"] << "]\\n";
