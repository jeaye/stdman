.SH NAME
std::valarray::shift \- std::valarray::shift

.SH Synopsis
   valarray<T> shift( int count ) const;

   Returns a new valarray of the same size with elements whose positions are shifted by
   count elements. The new position of each element is i−count where i is the previous
   position. The value of shifted in elements is T().

.SH Parameters

   count - number of positions to shift the elements by

.SH Return value

   The resulting valarray with shifted elements.

.SH Notes

   The function can be implemented with the return type different from std::valarray.
   In this case, the replacement type has the following properties:

     * All const member functions of std::valarray are provided.
     * std::valarray, std::slice_array, std::gslice_array, std::mask_array and
       std::indirect_array can be constructed from the replacement type.
     * All functions accepting an argument of type const std::valarray&
       except begin() and end()
       \fI(since C++14)\fP should also accept the replacement type.
     * All functions accepting two arguments of type const std::valarray& should accept
       every combination of const std::valarray& and the replacement type.
     * The return type does not add more than two levels of template nesting over the
       most deeply-nested argument type.
