.SH NAME
std::future<T>::share \- std::future<T>::share

.SH Synopsis
   std::shared_future<T> share() noexcept;

   Transfers the shared state of *this, if any, to a std::shared_future object.
   Multiple std::shared_future objects may reference the same shared state, which is
   not possible with std::future.

   After calling share on a std::future, valid() == false.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   A std::shared_future object containing the shared state previously held by *this, if
   any, constructed as if by std::shared_future<T>(std:move(*this)).
