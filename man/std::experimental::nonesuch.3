.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/type_traits>
   struct nonesuch {

       nonesuch() = delete;
       ~nonesuch() = delete;                      (library fundamentals TS v2)
       nonesuch(nonesuch const&) = delete;
       void operator=(nonesuch const&) = delete;

   };

   std::experimental::nonesuch is a class type used by std::experimental::detected_t to
   indicate detection failure.

.SH Notes

   nonesuch cannot be constructed, destroyed, or copied in the usual way. However, it
   is an aggregate and therefore can be constructed (presumably unintentionally) via
   aggregate initialization in contexts where the destructor's availability is not an
   issue, such as a new-expression: new std::experimental::nonesuch{}.

   Additionally, for overload resolution purposes, an implicit conversion sequence can
   be formed from {} (an empty braced-init-list) to nonesuch. This can cause surprising
   ambiguities:

 struct such {};
 void f(const such&);
 void f(const std::experimental::nonesuch&);
 f({}); // ambiguous
