.TH std::wcsncpy 3 "2018.03.28" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::wcsncpy \- std::wcsncpy

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cwchar>
   wchar_t *wcsncpy( wchar_t *dest, const wchar_t *src, std::size_t count );

   Copies at most count characters of the wide string pointed to by src (including the
   terminating null wide character) to wide character array pointed to by dest.

   If count is reached before the entire string src was copied, the resulting wide
   character array is not null-terminated.

   If, after copying the terminating null wide character from src, count is not
   reached, additional null wide characters are written to dest until the total of
   count characters have been written.

   If the strings overlap, the behavior is undefined.

.SH Parameters

   dest  - pointer to the wide character array to copy to
   src   - pointer to the wide string to copy from
   count - maximum number of wide characters to copy

.SH Return value

   dest

.SH Notes

   In typical usage, count is the size of the destination array.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <cwchar>
  
 int main()
 {
     wchar_t src[] = L"hi";
     wchar_t dest[6] = {L'a', L'b', L'c', L'd', L'e', L'f'};
  
     std::wcsncpy(dest, src, 5); // this will copy hi and repeat \\0 three times
  
     std::wcout << "The contents of dest are: ";
     for(wchar_t c : dest) {
         if(c)
             std::wcout << c << ' ';
         else
             std::wcout << "\\\\0" << ' ';
     }
     std::wcout << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 The contents of dest are: h i \\0 \\0 \\0 f
