.SH NAME
std::unique_ptr::reset \- std::unique_ptr::reset

.SH Synopsis
   members of the primary template, unique_ptr<T>
   void reset( pointer ptr = pointer() ) noexcept;    \fB(1)\fP
   members of the specialization unique_ptr<T[]>
   template< class U >                                \fB(2)\fP
   void reset( U ) noexcept;
   void reset( std::nullptr_t p = nullptr ) noexcept; \fB(3)\fP

   Replaces the managed object.

   1) Given current_ptr, the pointer that was managed by *this, performs the following
   actions, in this order:

    1. Saves a copy of the current pointer old_ptr = current_ptr
    2. Overwrites the current pointer with the argument current_ptr = ptr
    3. If the old pointer was non-empty, deletes the previously managed object
       if(old_ptr) get_deleter()(old_ptr).

   2) Behaves the same as the reset member of the primary template, except that it will
   only participate in overload resolution if either

    1. U is the same type as pointer, or
    2. pointer is the same type as element_type* and U is a pointer type V* such that
       V(*)[] is convertible to element_type(*)[].

   3) Equivalent to reset(pointer())

.SH Parameters

   ptr - pointer to a new object to manage

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Notes

   To replace the managed object while supplying a new deleter as well, move assignment
   operator may be used.

   A test for self-reset, i.e. whether ptr points to an object already managed by
   *this, is not performed, except where provided as a compiler extension or as a
   debugging assert. Note that code such as p.reset(p.release()) does not involve
   self-reset, only code like p.reset(p.get()) does.

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <memory>

 struct Foo { // object to manage
     Foo() { std::cout << "Foo...\\n"; }
     ~Foo() { std::cout << "~Foo...\\n"; }
 };

 struct D { // deleter
     void operator() (Foo* p) {
         std::cout << "Calling delete for Foo object... \\n";
         delete p;
     }
 };

 int main()
 {
     std::cout << "Creating new Foo...\\n";
     std::unique_ptr<Foo, D> up(new Foo(), D());  // up owns the Foo pointer (deleter D)

     std::cout << "Replace owned Foo with a new Foo...\\n";
     up.reset(new Foo());  // calls deleter for the old one

     std::cout << "Release and delete the owned Foo...\\n";
     up.reset(nullptr);
 }

.SH Output:

 Creating new Foo...
 Foo...
 Replace owned Foo with a new Foo...
 Foo...
 Calling delete for Foo object...
 ~Foo...
 Release and delete the owned Foo...
 Calling delete for Foo object...
 ~Foo...
