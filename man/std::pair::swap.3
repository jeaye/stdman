.SH NAME
std::pair::swap \- std::pair::swap

.SH Synopsis
   void swap(pair& other) noexcept(/* see below */);            \fI(since C++11)\fP
                                                                \fI(until C++20)\fP
   constexpr void swap(pair& other) noexcept(/* see below */);  \fI(since C++20)\fP

   Swaps first with other.first and second with other.second.

.SH Parameters

   other - pair of values to swap

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Exceptions

   noexcept specification:  
   noexcept(

        noexcept(swap(first, other.first)) &&
        noexcept(swap(second, other.second))                              \fI(until C++17)\fP

   )

   In the expression above, the identifier swap is looked up in the same
   manner as the one used by the C++17 std::is_nothrow_swappable trait.
   noexcept specification:  
   noexcept(

        std::is_nothrow_swappable_v<first_type> &&                        \fI(since C++17)\fP
        std::is_nothrow_swappable_v<second_type>

   )

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <utility>
 #include <string>
 int main()
 {
     std::pair<int, std::string> p1, p2;
     p1 = std::make_pair(10, "test");
     p2.swap(p1);
     std::cout << "(" << p2.first << ", " << p2.second << ")\\n";
 }

.SH Output:

 (10, test)
