.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <optional>
   template< class T >           \fI(since C++17)\fP
   class optional;

   The class template std::optional manages an optional contained value, i.e. a value
   that may or may not be present.

   A common use case for optional is the return value of a function that may fail. As
   opposed to other approaches, such as std::pair<T,bool>, optional handles
   expensive-to-construct objects well and is more readable, as the intent is expressed
   explicitly.

   Any instance of optional<T> at any given point in time either contains a value or
   does not contain a value.

   If an optional<T> contains a value, the value is guaranteed to be allocated as part
   of the optional object footprint, i.e. no dynamic memory allocation ever takes
   place. Thus, an optional object models an object, not a pointer, even though the
   operator*() and operator->() are defined.

   When an object of type optional<T> is contextually converted to bool, the conversion
   returns true if the object contains a value and false if it does not contain a
   value.

   The optional object contains a value in the following conditions:

     * The object is initialized with a value of type T
     * The object is assigned from another optional that contains a value.

   The object does not contain a value in the following conditions:

     * The object is default-initialized.
     * The object is initialized with a value of std::nullopt_t or an optional object
       that does not contain a value.
     * The object is assigned from a value of std::nullopt_t or from an optional that
       does not contain a value

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <string>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <optional>
  
 // optional can be used as the return type of a factory that may fail
 std::optional<std::string> create(bool b) {
     if(b)
         return "Godzilla";
     else
         return {};
 }
  
 int main()
 {
     std::cout << "create(false) returned "
               << create(false).value_or("empty") << '\\n';
  
     // optional-returning factory functions are usable as conditions of while and if
     if(auto str = create(true)) {
         std::cout << "create(true) returned " << *str << '\\n';
     }
 }

.SH Output:

 create(false) returned empty
 create(true) returned Godzilla
