.SH NAME
std::fpos \- std::fpos

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <ios>
   template< class State >
   class fpos;

   Specializations of the class template std::fpos identify absolute positions in a
   stream or in a file. Each object of type fpos holds the byte position in the stream
   (typically as a private member of type std::streamoff) and the current shift state,
   a value of type State (typically std::mbstate_t).

   The following specializations of std::fpos are provided:

   Type       Definition
   streampos  std::fpos<std::char_traits<char>::state_type>
   wstreampos std::fpos<std::char_traits<wchar_t>::state_type>

   In addition, std::u16streampos and std::u32streampos are provided as   \fI(since C++11)\fP
   implementation-defined types that satisfy the requirements of pos_type

.SH Member functions

   state gets/sets the value of the shift state
         \fI(public member function)\fP

   In addition, the following member functions and operators must be provided, although
   it's unspecified if they are members or non-member.

     * A constructor that accepts an argument of type int.

     * A constructor that accepts an argument of type std::streamoff. This constructor
       must also accept the special value std::streamoff(-1): the std::fpos constructed
       in this manner is returned by some stream operations to indicate errors.

     * A conversion operator that converts fpos to std::streamoff with the value equal
       to the offset from std::fpos\fB(0)\fP.

     * operator== that compares two objects of type std::fpos and returns a value of
       type convertible to bool

     * operator!= that compares two objects of type std::fpos and returns a value of
       type convertible to bool

     * operator+ and operator+= which can add std::streamoff to std::fpos

     * operator- and operator-= which can subtract std::streamoff from an std::fpos

     * operator- which can subtract two objects of type std::fpos producing an
       std::streamoff

.SH Notes

   std::streampos and std::wstreampos are required to be the same type because
   std::char_traits<char>::state_type and std::char_traits<wchar_t>::state_type are
   required to both be std::mbstate_t. C++98 had a self-contradictory statement that
   they may be different if the implementation supports no shift encoding in
   narrow-oriented iostreams but supports one or more shift encodings in wide-oriented
   streams, but that was corrected in C++03.

   Some of the I/O streams member functions return and manipulate objects of member
   typedef pos_type. For streams, these member typedefs are provided by the template
   parameter Traits, which defaults to std::char_traits, which define their pos_types
   to be specializations of std::fpos. The behavior of the I/O streams library is
   implementation-defined when Traits::pos_type is not std::fpos<std::mbstate_t> (aka
   std::streampos or std::wstreampos).
