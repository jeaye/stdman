std::lconv \- std::lconv

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <clocale>
   struct lconv;

   The class std::lconv contains numeric and monetary formatting rules as defined by a
   C locale. Objects of this struct may be obtained with std::localeconv. The members
   of std::lconv are values of type char and of type char*. Each char* member except
   decimal_point may be pointing at a null character (that is, at an empty C-string).
   The members of type char are all non-negative numbers, any of which may be CHAR_MAX
   if the corresponding value is not available in the current C locale.

                           indicates the separation of currency_symbol, positive_sign,
   char int_p_sep_by_space and the non-negative international monetary value
                           \fI(public member object)\fP
                           indicates the separation of currency_symbol, negative_sign,
   char int_n_sep_by_space and the negative international monetary value
                           \fI(public member object)\fP
                           indicates the position of positive_sign in a non-negative
   char int_p_sign_posn    international monetary value
                           \fI(public member object)\fP
                           indicates the position of negative_sign in a negative
   char int_n_sign_posn    international monetary value
                           \fI(public member object)\fP

   The characters of the C-strings pointed to by grouping and mon_grouping are
   interpreted according to their numeric values. When the terminating '\\0' is
   encountered, the last value seen is assumed to repeat for the remainder of digits.
   If CHAR_MAX is encountered, no further digits are grouped. the typical grouping of
   three digits at a time is "\\003".

   The values of p_sep_by_space, n_sep_by_space, int_p_sep_by_space, int_n_sep_by_space
   are interpreted as follows:

   0 no space separates the currency symbol and the value
   1 sign sticks to the currency symbol, value is separated by a space
   2 sign sticks to the value. Currency symbol is separated by a space

   The values of p_sign_posn, n_sign_posn, int_p_sign_posn, int_n_sign_posn are
   interpreted as follows:

   0 parentheses around the value and the currency symbol are used to represent the
     sign
   1 sign before the value and the currency symbol
   2 sign after the value and the currency symbol
   3 sign before the currency symbol
   4 sign after the currency symbol

.SH Example

   
   
// Run this code

 #include <clocale>
 #include <iostream>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::setlocale(LC_ALL, "ja_JP.UTF-8");
     std::lconv* lc = std::localeconv();
     std::cout << "Japanese currency symbol: " << lc->currency_symbol
               << '(' << lc->int_curr_symbol << ")\\n";
 }

.SH Output:

 Japanese currency symbol: ￥(JPY )
