.SH NAME
std::pmr::monotonic_buffer_resource::do_is_equal \- std::pmr::monotonic_buffer_resource::do_is_equal

.SH Synopsis
   virtual bool do_is_equal( const std::pmr::memory_resource& other )     \fI(since C++17)\fP
   const noexcept;

   Compare *this with other for identity - memory allocated using a
   monotonic_buffer_resource can only be deallocated using that same resource.
