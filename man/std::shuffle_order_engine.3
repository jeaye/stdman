   > class shuffle_order_engine;

   shuffle_order_engine is a random number engine adaptor that shuffles the random
   numbers generated by the base engine. It maintains a table of size K and delivers a
   randomly selected number from that table when requested, replacing it with a number
   generated by the base engine.

   The following typedef defines the random number engine with one commonly used
   parameter set:

   Type            Definition
   knuth_b \fI(C++11)\fP std::shuffle_order_engine<std::minstd_rand0, 256>

.SH Template parameters

   Engine  -  the type of the wrapped engine
   K       -  the size of the internal table. Must be greater than 0.
.SH Type requirements
   -
   Engine must meet the requirements of RandomNumberEngine.

.SH Member types

   Member type         Definition
   result_type \fI(C++11)\fP Engine::result_type

.SH Member functions

   constructor      constructs the engine adaptor
   \fI(C++11)\fP          \fI(public member function)\fP
   seed             sets the state of the underlying engine
   \fI(C++11)\fP          \fI(public member function)\fP
   base             returns the underlying engine
   \fI(C++11)\fP          \fI(public member function)\fP
.SH Generation
   operator()       advances the state of the underlying engine and returns the
   \fI(C++11)\fP          generated value
                    \fI(public member function)\fP
   discard          advances the adaptor's state by a specified amount
   \fI(C++11)\fP          \fI(public member function)\fP
.SH Characteristics
   min              gets the smallest possible value in the output range of the
   \fB[static]\fP \fI(C++11)\fP underlying engine.
                    \fI(public static member function)\fP
   max              gets the largest possible value in the output range of the
   \fB[static]\fP \fI(C++11)\fP underlying engine.
                    \fI(public static member function)\fP

.SH Non-member functions

   operator==                compares the internal states of the adaptors and
   operator!=                underlying engines
   \fI(C++11)\fP                   \fI(function)\fP
   \fI(C++11)\fP(removed in C++20)
   operator<<                performs stream input and output on pseudo-random number
   operator>>                engine adaptor
   \fI(C++11)\fP                   \fI(function)\fP

.SH Member objects
