.SH NAME
std::basic_istringstream::operator= \- std::basic_istringstream::operator=

.SH Synopsis
   basic_istringstream& operator=( basic_istringstream&& other );  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Move assigns the string stream other to *this, effectively move-assigning both the
   std::basic_istream base class and the associated std::basic_stringbuf.

   Note that the base class move assignment swaps all stream state variables (except
   for rdbuf) between *this and other.

.SH Parameters

   other - string stream to move from

.SH Return value

   *this
