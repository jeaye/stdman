.TH std::atomic::store 3 "Jun 28 2014" "2.0 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   void store( T desired, memory_order = std::memory_order_seq_cst );
   void store( T desired, memory_order = std::memory_order_seq_cst )     \fI(since C++11)\fP
   volatile;

   Atomically replaces the current value with desired. Memory is affected according to
   the value of memory_order.

   memory_order must be one of std::memory_order_relaxed, std::memory_order_release or
   std::memory_order_seq_cst. Otherwise the behavior is undefined.

.SH Parameters

   desired      - the value to store into the atomic variable
   memory_order - memory order constraints to enforce

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Exceptions

   noexcept specification:
