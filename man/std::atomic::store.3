.SH NAME
std::atomic::store \- std::atomic::store

.SH Synopsis
   void store( T desired, std::memory_order order =
   std::memory_order_seq_cst );                                          \fI(since C++11)\fP
   void store( T desired, std::memory_order order =
   std::memory_order_seq_cst ) volatile;

   Atomically replaces the current value with desired. Memory is affected according to
   the value of order.

   order must be one of std::memory_order_relaxed, std::memory_order_release or
   std::memory_order_seq_cst. Otherwise the behavior is undefined.

.SH Parameters

   desired - the value to store into the atomic variable
   order   - memory order constraints to enforce

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Exceptions

   noexcept specification:
   noexcept
