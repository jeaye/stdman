   const );

   Creates a member function wrapper object, deducing the target type from the template
   arguments. The wrapper object expects a pointer to an object of type T as the first
   parameter to its operator().

   1) Effectively calls std::mem_fun_t<S,T>(f) or std::const_mem_fun_t<S,T>(f).
   2) Effectively calls std::mem_fun1_t<S,T>(f) or std::const_mem_fun1_t<S,T>(f).

   This function and the related types were deprecated in C++11 and removed in C++17 in
   favor of the more general std::mem_fn and std::bind, both of which create callable
   adapter-compatible function objects from member functions.

.SH Parameters

   f - pointer to a member function to create a wrapper for

.SH Return value

   A function object wrapping f.

.SH Exceptions

   May throw implementation-defined exceptions.

.SH Notes

   The difference between std::mem_fun and std::mem_fun_ref is that the former produces
   an function wrapper that expects a pointer to an object, whereas the latter -- a
   reference.
