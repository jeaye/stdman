.TH std::locale::global 3 "2018.03.28" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::locale::global \- std::locale::global

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <locale>
   static locale global( const locale& loc );

   Replaces the global C++ locale with loc, which means all future calls to the
   std::locale default constructor will now return a copy of loc. If loc has a name,
   also replaces the C locale as if by std::setlocale(LC_ALL, loc.name().c_str());.
   This function is the only way to modify the global C++ locale, which is otherwise
   equivalent to std::locale::classic() at program startup.

.SH Parameters

   loc - the new global C++ locale

.SH Return value

   The previous value of the global C++ locale.
