.SH NAME
std::basic_streambuf::snextc \- std::basic_streambuf::snextc

.SH Synopsis
   int_type snextc();

   Advances the input sequence by one character and reads one character.

   The function calls sbumpc() to advance the input sequence. If that function returns
   Traits::eof() meaning that input sequence has been exhausted and uflow() could not
   retrieve more data, Traits::eof() is returned. Otherwise sgetc() is called in order
   to read the character.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   The value of the next character. If the input sequence has been exhausted,
   Traits::eof() is returned.
