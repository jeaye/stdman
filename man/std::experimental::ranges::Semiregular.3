.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/ranges/concepts>
   template <class T>
   concept bool Semiregular = ranges::Copyable<T> &&                        (ranges TS)
   ranges::DefaultConstructible<T>;

   The Semiregular concept specifies that a type is both copyable and default
   constructible. It is satisfied by types that behave similarly to built-in types like
   int, except that they may not support comparison with ==.
