std::underlying_type \- std::underlying_type

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <type_traits>
   template< class T >              \fI(since C++11)\fP
   struct underlying_type;

   If T is a complete enumeration type, provides a member typedef type that names the
   underlying type of T.

   Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

.SH Member types

   Name Definition
   type the underlying type of T

   template< class T >                                           \fI(since C++14)\fP
   using underlying_type_t = typename underlying_type<T>::type;

.SH Notes

   Each enumeration type has an underlying type, which can be

   1. Specified explicitly (both scoped and unscoped enumerations)

   2. Omitted, in which case it is int for scoped enumerations or an
   implementation-defined integral type capable of representing all values of the enum
   (for unscoped enumerations)

   Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to
   previously published C++ standards.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <type_traits>
  
 enum e1 {};
 enum class e2: int {};
  
 int main() {
     bool e1_type = std::is_same<
         unsigned
        ,typename std::underlying_type<e1>::type
     >::value;
  
     bool e2_type = std::is_same<
         int
        ,typename std::underlying_type<e2>::type
     >::value;
  
     std::cout
     << "underlying type for 'e1' is " << (e1_type?"unsigned":"non-unsigned") << '\\n'
     << "underlying type for 'e2' is " << (e2_type?"int":"non-int") << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 underlying type for 'e1' is unsigned
 underlying type for 'e2' is int
