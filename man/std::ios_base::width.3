   streamsize width( streamsize new_width ); \fB(2)\fP

   2) Sets the field width to the given one.

.SH Parameters

   new_width - new field width setting

   The field width before the call to the function

.SH Notes

   Some I/O functions call width\fB(0)\fP before returning, see std::setw (this results in
   this field having effect on the next I/O function only, and not on any subsequent
   I/O)

   The exact effects this modifier has on the input and output vary between the
   individual I/O functions and are described at each operator<< and operator>>
   overload page individually.
