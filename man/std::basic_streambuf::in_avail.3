.SH NAME
std::basic_streambuf::in_avail \- std::basic_streambuf::in_avail

.SH Synopsis
   std::streamsize in_avail();

   Returns the number of characters available in the get area. If a read position is
   available, effectively returns egptr() - gptr(), the size of the get area. In this
   case, the number of bytes returned is the number of bytes that can be extracted from
   the buffer without calling underflow().

   If the get area is empty, calls showmanyc() to determine the number of bytes
   available in the associated character sequence. In this case, the value returned is
   the number of bytes that can be extracted from the buffer while it's guaranteed that
   underflow() would not return Traits::eof.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   The number of characters available for non-blocking read (either the size of the get
   area or the number of characters ready for reading from the associated character
   sequence), or -1 if no characters are available in the associated sequence as far as
   showmanyc() can tell.
