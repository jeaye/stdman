   Constructs new synchronized output stream

   1-4) constructs the private member std::basic_syncbuf using the buffer and the
   allocator provided, and initializes the base class with a pointer to the member
   std::basic_streambuf.
   5) Move constructor. Move-constructs the std::basic_ostream base and the
   std::basic_syncbuf member from the corresponding subobjects of other, then calls
   set_rdbuf with the pointer to the newly-constructed underlying std::basic_syncbuf to
   complete the initialization of the base. After this move constructor,
   other.get_wrapped() returns nullptr and destruction of other produces no output.

.SH Parameters

   buf   - pointer to the std::basic_streambuf that will be wrapped
   os    - reference to a std::basic_ostream, whose rdbuf() will be wrapped
   a     - the allocator to pass to the constructor of the member std::basic_syncbuf
   other - another osyncstream to move from
