.TH std::fputs 3 "2018.03.28" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::fputs \- std::fputs

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstdio>
   int fputs( const char* str, std::FILE* stream );

   Writes every character from the null-terminated string str to the output stream
   stream, as if by repeatedly executing std::fputc.

   The terminating null character from str is not written.

.SH Parameters

   str    - null-terminated character string to be written
   stream - output stream

.SH Return value

   On success, returns a non-negative value

   On failure, returns EOF and sets the error indicator (see std::ferror) on stream.

.SH Notes

   The related function std::puts appends a newline character to the output, while
   std::fputs writes the string unmodified.

   Different implementations return different non-negative numbers: some return the
   last character written, some return the number of characters written (or INT_MAX if
   the string was longer than that), some simply return a non-negative constant such as
   zero.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <cstdio>
  
 int main(void)
 {
     int rc = std::fputs("Hello World", stdout);
  
     if (rc == EOF)
        std::perror("fputs()"); // POSIX requires that errno is set
 }

.SH Output:

 Hello World
