.SH NAME
std::basic_istream::gcount \- std::basic_istream::gcount

.SH Synopsis
   std::streamsize gcount() const;

   Returns the number of characters extracted by the last unformatted input operation,
   or the maximum representable value of std::streamsize if the number is not
   representable.

   The following member functions of basic_istream change the value of subsequent
   gcount() calls:

     * move constructor
     * swap()
     * get()
     * getline()
     * ignore()
     * read()
     * readsome()
     * operator>>(basic_streambuf*)

   The following functions set gcount() to zero:

     * constructor
     * putback()
     * unget()
     * peek()

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   The number of characters extracted by the last unformatted input operation, or the
   maximum representable value of std::streamsize if the number is not representable.

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <sstream>

 int main()
 {
     char x[20];
     std::istringstream stream("Hello World");

     stream.read(x, sizeof x);
     std::cout << "Characters extracted: " << stream.gcount();
 }

.SH Output:

 Characters extracted: 11
