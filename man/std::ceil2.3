std::ceil2 \- std::ceil2

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <bit>
   template< class T >               \fI(since C++20)\fP
   constexpr T ceil2(T x) noexcept;

   Calculates the smallest integral power of two that is not smaller than x. If that
   value is not representable in T, the result is unspecified.

   This overload only participates in overload resolution if T is an unsigned integer
   type (that is, unsigned char, unsigned short, unsigned int, unsigned long, unsigned
   long long, or an extended unsigned integer type).

.SH Return value

   The smallest integral power of two that is not smaller than x, or an unspecified
   value if the result cannot be represented in T.
