.SH NAME
std::weak_ptr::expired \- std::weak_ptr::expired

.SH Synopsis
   bool expired() const;  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Checks whether the managed object has already been deleted. Equivalent to
   use_count() == 0.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   true if the managed object has already been deleted, false otherwise.

.SH Exceptions

   noexcept specification:
   noexcept

.SH Example

   Demonstrates how expired is used to check validity of the pointer.

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <memory>

 std::weak_ptr<int> gw;

 void f()
 {
     if (!gw.expired()) {
         std::cout << "gw is valid\\n";
     }
     else {
         std::cout << "gw is expired\\n";
     }
 }

 int main()
 {
     {
         auto sp = std::make_shared<int>(42);
         gw = sp;

         f();
     }

     f();
 }

.SH Output:

 gw is valid
 gw is expired
