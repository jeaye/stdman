.SH Synopsis
   constexpr auto end() requires (!__SimpleView<V>);                  \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++20)\fP
   constexpr auto end() const requires

   ranges::range<const V> &&                                          \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++20)\fP

   std::indirect_unary_predicate<const Pred, ranges::iterator_t<const
   V>>;

   Returns a sentinel representing the end of the view.

   1) Effectively returns /*sentinel*/<false>(ranges::end(base_),
   std::addressof(pred())), where base_ denotes the underlying view.
   2) Effectively returns /*sentinel*/<true>(ranges::end(base_),
   std::addressof(pred())), where base_ denotes the underlying view.

   Overload \fB(1)\fP does not participate in overload resolution if V is a simple view (that
   is, if V and const V are views with the same iterator and sentinel types).

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   sentinel representing the end of the view.
