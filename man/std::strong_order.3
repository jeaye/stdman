std::strong_order \- std::strong_order

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <compare>
   inline namespace /* unspecified */ {

       inline constexpr /* unspecified */ strong_order = /* unspecified   \fI(since C++20)\fP
   */;

   }
   Call signature
   template< class T, class U >

       requires /* see below */

   constexpr std::strong_ordering strong_order(T&& t, U&& u) noexcept(/*
   see below */);

   Compares two values using 3-way comparison and produces a result of type
   std::strong_ordering

   Let t and u be expressions and T and U denote decltype((t)) and decltype((u))
   respectively, std::strong_order(t, u) is expression-equivalent to:

     * If std::is_same_v<std::decay_t<T>, std::decay_t<U>> == true:

          * std::strong_ordering(strong_order(t, u)), if it is a well-formed expression
            with overload resolution performed in a context that does not include a
            declaration of std::strong_order,
          * otherwise, if T is a floating-point type:

               * if std::numeric_limits<T>::is_iec559 is true, performs the
                 ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559 totalOrder comparison of floating-point values and
                 returns that result as a value of type std::strong_ordering (note:
                 this comparison can distinguish between the positive and negative zero
                 and between the NaNs with different representations),
               * otherwise, yields a value of type std::strong_ordering that is
                 consistent with the ordering observed by T's comparison operators,

          * otherwise, std::strong_ordering(std::compare_three_way()(t, u)) if it is
            well-formed,
          * otherwise, the expression is ill-formed, which can result in substitution
            failure when it appears in the immediate context of a template
            instantiation.

     * Otherwise, std::strong_order(t, u) is ill-formed.

.SH Notes

     Strict total order of IEEE floating-point types

   Let x and y be values of same IEEE floating-point type, and total_order_less(x, y)
   be the boolean result indicating if x precedes y in the strict total order defined
   by totalOrder in ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559.

   (total_order_less(x, y) || total_order_less(y, x)) == false if and only if x and y
   have the same bit pattern.

     * if neither x nor y is NaN:

          * if x < y, then total_order_less(x, y) == true;
          * if x == y,

               * if x is negative zero and y is positive zero, total_order_less(x, y)
                 == true,
               * if x is not zero and x's exponent field is less than y's, then
                 total_order_less(x, y) == (x > 0) (only meaningful for decimal
                 floating-point number);

     * if either x or y is NaN:

          * if x is negative NaN and y is not negative NaN, then total_order_less(x, y)
            == true,
          * if x is not positive NaN and y is positive NaN, then total_order_less(x, y)
            == true,
          * if both x and y are NaNs with the same sign and x's mantissa field is less
            than y's, then total_order_less(x, y) == !std::signbit(x).
