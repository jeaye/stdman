   constexpr std::strong_ordering strong_order( T&& t, U&& u )

   Compares two values using 3-way comparison and produces a result of type
   std::strong_ordering

   Let t and u be expressions and T and U denote decltype((t)) and decltype((u))
   respectively, std::strong_order(t, u) is expression-equivalent to:

     * If std::is_same_v<std::decay_t<T>, std::decay_t<U>> is true:

          * std::strong_ordering(strong_order(t, u)), if it is a well-formed expression
            with overload resolution performed in a context that does not include a
            declaration of std::strong_order,
          * otherwise, if T is a floating-point type:

               * if std::numeric_limits<T>::is_iec559 is true, performs the
                 ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559 totalOrder comparison of floating-point values and
                 returns that result as a value of type std::strong_ordering (note:
                 this comparison can distinguish between the positive and negative zero
                 and between the NaNs with different representations),
               * otherwise, yields a value of type std::strong_ordering that is
                 consistent with the ordering observed by T's comparison operators,

          * otherwise, std::strong_ordering(std::compare_three_way()(t, u)) if it is
            well-formed.

     * In all other cases, the expression is ill-formed, which can result in
       substitution failure when it appears in the immediate context of a template
       instantiation.

  Expression-equivalent

   Expression e is expression-equivalent to expression f, if e and f have the same
   effects, either are both potentially-throwing or are both not potentially-throwing
   (i.e. noexcept(e) == noexcept(f)), and either are both constant subexpressions or
   are both not constant subexpressions.

  Customization point objects

   The name std::strong_order denotes a customization point object, which is a const
   function object of a literal semiregular class type. For exposition purposes, the
   cv-unqualified version of its type is denoted as __strong_order_fn.

   All instances of __strong_order_fn are equal. The effects of invoking different
   instances of type __strong_order_fn on the same arguments are equivalent, regardless
   of whether the expression denoting the instance is an lvalue or rvalue, and is
   const-qualified or not (however, a volatile-qualified instance is not required to be
   invocable). Thus, std::strong_order can be copied freely and its copies can be used
   interchangeably.

   Given a set of types Args..., if std::declval<Args>()... meet the requirements for
   arguments to std::strong_order above, __strong_order_fn models
   std::invocable<__strong_order_fn, Args...>, std::invocable<const __strong_order_fn,
   Args...>, std::invocable<__strong_order_fn&, Args...>, and std::invocable<const
   __strong_order_fn&, Args...>. Otherwise, no function call operator of
   __strong_order_fn participates in overload resolution.

.SH Notes

    Strict total order of IEEE floating-point types

   Let x and y be values of same IEEE floating-point type, and total_order_less(x, y)
   be the boolean result indicating if x precedes y in the strict total order defined
   by totalOrder in ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559.

   (total_order_less(x, y) || total_order_less(y, x)) == false if and only if x and y
   have the same bit pattern.

     * if neither x nor y is NaN:

          * if x < y, then total_order_less(x, y) == true;
          * if x > y, then total_order_less(x, y) == false;
          * if x == y,

               * if x is negative zero and y is positive zero, total_order_less(x, y)
                 == true,
               * if x is not zero and x's exponent field is less than y's, then
                 total_order_less(x, y) == (x > 0) (only meaningful for decimal
                 floating-point number);

     * if either x or y is NaN:

          * if x is negative NaN and y is not negative NaN, then total_order_less(x, y)
            == true,
          * if x is not positive NaN and y is positive NaN, then total_order_less(x, y)
            == true,
          * if both x and y are NaNs with the same sign and x's mantissa field is less
            than y's, then total_order_less(x, y) == !std::signbit(x).
