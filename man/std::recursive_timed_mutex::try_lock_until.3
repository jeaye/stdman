.SH NAME
std::recursive_timed_mutex::try_lock_until \- std::recursive_timed_mutex::try_lock_until

.SH Synopsis
   template< class Clock, class Duration >
   bool try_lock_until( const std::chrono::time_point<Clock, Duration>&   \fI(since C++11)\fP
   timeout_time );

   Tries to lock the mutex. Blocks until specified timeout_time has been reached
   (timeout) or the lock is acquired (owns the mutex), whichever comes first. On
   successful lock acquisition returns true, otherwise returns false.

   If timeout_time has already passed, this function behaves like try_lock().

   Clock must meet the Clock requirements.
   The program is ill-formed if std::chrono::is_clock_v<Clock> is false.
   \fI(since C++20)\fP

   The standard recommends that the clock tied to timeout_time be used, in which case
   adjustments of the clock may be taken into account. Thus, the duration of the block
   might be more or less than timeout_time - Clock::now() at the time of the call,
   depending on the direction of the adjustment and whether it is honored by the
   implementation. The function also may block until after timeout_time has been
   reached due to process scheduling or resource contention delays.

   As with try_lock(), this function is allowed to fail spuriously and return false
   even if the mutex was not locked by any other thread at some point before
   timeout_time.

   Prior unlock() operation on the same mutex synchronizes-with (as defined in
   std::memory_order) this operation if it returns true.

   A thread may call try_lock_until on a recursive mutex repeatedly. Successful calls
   to try_lock_until increment the ownership count: the mutex will only be released
   after the thread makes a matching number of calls to unlock.

   The maximum number of levels of ownership is unspecified. A call to try_lock_until
   will return false if this number is exceeded.

.SH Parameters

   timeout_time - maximum time point to block until

.SH Return value

   true if the lock was acquired successfully, otherwise false.

.SH Exceptions

   Any exception thrown by timeout_time (clocks, time points, and durations provided by
   the standard library never throw).
