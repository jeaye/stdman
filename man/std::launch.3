.TH std::launch 3 "Sep  4 2015" "2.0 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <future>
   enum class launch : /* unspecified */ {

   async = /* unspecified */,
   deferred = /* unspecified */,            \fI(since C++11)\fP
   /* implementation-defined */

   };

   Specifies the launch policy for a task executed by the std::async function.
   std::launch is an enumeration used as BitmaskType.

   The following constants denoting individual bits are defined by the standard
   library:

   Constant              Explanation
   std::launch::async    a new thread is launched to execute the task asynchronously
   std::launch::deferred the task is executed on the calling thread the first time its
                         result is requested (lazy evaluation)

   In addition, implementations are allowed to:

     * define additional bits and bitmasks to specify restrictions on task interactions
       applicable to a subset of launch policies, and
     * enable those additional bitmasks for the first (default) overload of std::async.

   async   runs a function asynchronously (potentially in a new thread) and returns a
   \fI(C++11)\fP std::future that will hold the result
           \fI(function template)\fP
