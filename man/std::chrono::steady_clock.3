std::chrono::steady_clock \- std::chrono::steady_clock

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <chrono>
   class steady_clock;         \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Class std::chrono::steady_clock represents a monotonic clock. The time points of
   this clock cannot decrease as physical time moves forward and the time between ticks
   of this clock is constant. This clock is not related to wall clock time (for
   example, it can be time since last reboot), and is most suitable for measuring
   intervals.

   std::chrono::steady_clock meets the requirements of TrivialClock.

.SH Member types

   Member type Definition
   rep         arithmetic type representing the number of ticks in the clock's duration
   period      a std::ratio type representing the tick period of the clock, in seconds
