.SH NAME
std::chrono::steady_clock \- std::chrono::steady_clock

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <chrono>
   class steady_clock;         \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Class std::chrono::steady_clock represents a monotonic clock. The time points of
   this clock cannot decrease as physical time moves forward. This clock is not related
   to wall clock time (for example, it can be time since last reboot), and is most
   suitable for measuring intervals.

   std::chrono::steady_clock meets the requirements of TrivialClock.

.SH Member types

   Member type Definition
   rep         arithmetic type representing the number of ticks in the clock's duration
   period      a std::ratio type representing the tick period of the clock, in seconds
   duration    std::chrono::duration<rep, period>
   time_point  std::chrono::time_point<std::chrono::steady_clock>
