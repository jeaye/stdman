.SH NAME
std::experimental::filesystem::directory_options \- std::experimental::filesystem::directory_options

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/filesystem>
   enum class directory_options {

       none,
       follow_directory_symlink,                (filesystem TS)
       skip_permission_denied

   };

   This type represents available options that control the behavior of the
   directory_iterator and recursive_directory_iterator.

   directory_options satisfies the requirements of BitmaskType (which means the bitwise
   operators operator&, operator|, operator^, operator~, operator&=, operator|=, and
   operator^= are defined for this type)

.SH Member constants
