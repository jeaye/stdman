   T* fetch_add( std::ptrdiff_t arg,
                 std::memory_order order = std::memory_order_seq_cst )
   noexcept;                                                                      \fB(2)\fP

   volatile noexcept;

   Atomically replaces the current value with the result of arithmetic addition of the
   value and arg. The operation is read-modify-write operation. Memory is affected
   according to the value of order.

   For signed Integral types, arithmetic is defined to use twoâ€™s complement
   representation. There are no undefined results.

   For floating-point types, the floating-point environment in effect may
   be different from the calling thread's floating-point environment. The
   operation need not be conform to the corresponding std::numeric_limits (since C++20)
   traits but is encouraged to do so. If the result is not a
   representable value for its type, the result is unspecified but the
   operation otherwise has no undefined behavior.

   For T* types, the result may be an undefined address, but the operation otherwise
   has no undefined behavior. The program is ill-formed if T is not an object type.

.SH Parameters

   arg   - the other argument of arithmetic addition
   order - memory order constraints to enforce

.SH Return value

   The value immediately preceding the effects of this function in the modification
   order of *this.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <thread>
 #include <atomic>
  
 std::atomic<long long> data;
 void do_work()
 {
     data.fetch_add(1, std::memory_order_relaxed);
 }
  
 int main()
 {
     std::thread th1(do_work);
     std::thread th2(do_work);
     std::thread th3(do_work);
     std::thread th4(do_work);
     std::thread th5(do_work);
  
     th1.join();
     th2.join();
     th3.join();
     th4.join();
     th5.join();
  
     std::cout << "Result:" << data << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 Result:5
