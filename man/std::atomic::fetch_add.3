std::atomic::fetch_add \- std::atomic::fetch_add

.SH Synopsis
   member only of atomic<Integral>\fI(C++11)\fP and atomic<Floating>(C++20)
   template specializations
   T fetch_add( T arg,
   std::memory_order order = std::memory_order_seq_cst ) noexcept;
   T fetch_add( T arg,
   std::memory_order order = std::memory_order_seq_cst ) volatile noexcept;
   member only of atomic<T*> template specialization                          \fB(1)\fP
   T* fetch_add( std::ptrdiff_t arg,
   std::memory_order order = std::memory_order_seq_cst ) noexcept;                \fB(2)\fP
   T* fetch_add( std::ptrdiff_t arg,
   std::memory_order order = std::memory_order_seq_cst ) volatile noexcept;

   Atomically replaces the current value with the result of arithmetic addition of the
   value and arg. That is, it performs atomic post-increment. The operation is
   read-modify-write operation. Memory is affected according to the value of order.

   For signed Integral types, arithmetic is defined to use two’s complement
   representation. There are no undefined results.

   For T* types, the result may be an undefined address, but the operation otherwise
   has no undefined behavior. The program is ill-formed if T is not an object type.

   For floating-point types, the floating-point environment in effect may
   be different from the calling thread's floating-point environment. The
   operation need not conform to the corresponding std::numeric_limits
   traits but is encouraged to do so. If the result is not a
   representable value for its type, the result is unspecified but the    \fI(since C++20)\fP
   operation otherwise has no undefined behavior.

   The volatile-qualified versions are deprecated if
   std::atomic<T>::is_always_lock_free is false.

.SH Parameters

   arg   - the other argument of arithmetic addition
   order - memory order constraints to enforce

.SH Return value

   The value immediately preceding the effects of this function in the modification
   order of *this.

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <thread>
 #include <atomic>
 #include <array>

 std::atomic<long long> data{10};
 std::array<long long, 5> return_values{};

 void do_work(int thread_num)
 {
     long long val = data.fetch_add(1, std::memory_order_relaxed);
     return_values[thread_num] = val;
 }

 int main()
 {
     {
         std::jthread th0{do_work, 0};
         std::jthread th1{do_work, 1};
         std::jthread th2{do_work, 2};
         std::jthread th3{do_work, 3};
         std::jthread th4{do_work, 4};
     }

     std::cout << "Result : " << data << '\\n';

     for (long long val : return_values) {
         std::cout << "Seen return value : " << val << std::endl;
     }
 }

.SH Possible output:

 Result : 15
 Seen return value : 11
 Seen return value : 10
 Seen return value : 14
 Seen return value : 12
 Seen return value : 13
