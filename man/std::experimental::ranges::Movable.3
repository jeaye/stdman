.SH NAME
std::experimental::ranges::Movable \- std::experimental::ranges::Movable

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/ranges/concepts>
   template < class T >

   concept bool Movable =
     std::is_object<T>::value &&                     (ranges TS)
     ranges::MoveConstructible<T> &&
     ranges::Assignable<T&, T> &&

     ranges::Swappable<T>;

   The concept Movable<T> specifies that T is an object type that can moved (that is,
   it can be move constructed, move assigned, and lvalues of type T can be swapped).

   There need not be any subsumption relationship between Movable<T> and
   std::is_object<T>::value.
