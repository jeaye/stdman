   Defined in header <ios>

       class CharT,
       class Traits = std::char_traits<CharT>

   > class basic_ios : public std::ios_base

   The class std::basic_ios provides facilities for interfacing with objects that have
   std::basic_streambuf interface. Several std::basic_ios objects can refer to one
   actual std::basic_streambuf object.

.SH Notes

   Straightforward implementation of std::basic_ios stores only the following members
   (which all depend on the template parameters and thus cannot be part of
   std::ios_base):

     * the fill character (see fill())
     * the tied stream pointer (see tie())
     * the associated stream buffer pointer (see rdbuf())

   Actual implementations vary:

   Microsoft Visual Studio stores just those three members.

   LLVM libc++ stores 1 less member: it maintains the rdbuf pointer as a void* member
   of ios_base.

   GNU libstdc++ stores 4 additional members: three cached facets and a flag to
   indicate that fill was initialized
