.SH NAME
std::unordered_multimap::emplace_hint \- std::unordered_multimap::emplace_hint

.SH Synopsis
   template< class... Args >                                      \fI(since C++11)\fP
   iterator emplace_hint( const_iterator hint, Args&&... args );

   Inserts a new element into the container, using hint as a suggestion where the
   element should go.

   The constructor of the element type (value_type, that is, std::pair<const Key, T>)
   is called with exactly the same arguments as supplied to the function, forwarded
   with std::forward<Args>(args)....

   If after the operation the new number of elements is greater than old
   max_load_factor() * bucket_count() a rehashing takes place.
   If rehashing occurs (due to the insertion), all iterators are invalidated. Otherwise
   (no rehashing), iterators are not invalidated.

.SH Parameters

   hint - iterator, used as a suggestion as to where to insert the new element
   args - arguments to forward to the constructor of the element

.SH Return value

   An iterator to the inserted element.

.SH Exceptions

   If an exception is thrown for any reason, this function has no effect (strong
   exception safety guarantee).

.SH Complexity

   Amortized constant on average, worst case linear in the size of the container.
