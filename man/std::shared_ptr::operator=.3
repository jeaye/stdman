.SH Synopsis
   shared_ptr& operator=( const shared_ptr& r );            \fB(1)\fP
   template< class Y >                                      \fB(1)\fP
   shared_ptr& operator=( const shared_ptr<Y>& r );
   shared_ptr& operator=( shared_ptr&& r );                 \fB(2)\fP
   template< class Y >                                      \fB(2)\fP
   shared_ptr& operator=( shared_ptr<Y>&& r );
   template< class Y >                                      \fB(3)\fP
   shared_ptr& operator=( std::auto_ptr<Y>&& r );
   template< class Y, class Deleter >                       \fB(4)\fP
   shared_ptr& operator=( std::unique_ptr<Y,Deleter>&& r );

   Replaces the managed object with the one managed by r.

   1) Shares ownership of the object managed by r. If r manages no object, *this
   manages no object too. Equivalent to shared_ptr<T>(r).swap(*this).

   2) Move-assigns a shared_ptr from r. After the assignment, *this contains a copy of
   the previous state of r, r is empty. Equivalent to
   shared_ptr<T>(std::move(r)).swap(*this).

   3) Transfers the ownership of the object managed by r to *this. If r manages no
   object, *this manages no object too. After the assignment, *this contains the
   pointer previously held by r, and use_count()==1; also r is empty. Equivalent to
   shared_ptr<T>(r).swap(*this).

   4) Transfers the ownership of the object managed by r to *this. The deleter
   associated to r is stored for future deletion of the managed object. r manages no
   object after the call. Equivalent to shared_ptr<T>(std::move(r)).swap(*this).

.SH Parameters

   r - another smart pointer to share the ownership to or acquire the ownership from

.SH Return value

   *this

.SH Notes

   The implementation may meet the requirements without creating a temporary shared_ptr
   object.
