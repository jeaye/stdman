.SH NAME
std::basic_streambuf::sputn,std::basic_streambuf::xsputn \- std::basic_streambuf::sputn,std::basic_streambuf::xsputn

.SH Synopsis
   std::streamsize sputn( const char_type* s, std::streamsize count );          \fB(1)\fP
   protected:                                                                   \fB(2)\fP
   virtual std::streamsize xsputn( const char_type* s, std::streamsize count );

   1) Calls xsputn(s, count) of the most derived class.
   2) Writes count characters to the output sequence from the character array whose
   first element is pointed to by s. The characters are written as if by repeated calls
   to sputc(). Writing stops when either count characters are written or a call to
   sputc() would have returned Traits::eof().

   If the put area becomes full (pptr() == epptr()), this function may call overflow(),
   or achieve the effect of calling overflow() by some other, unspecified, means.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   The number of characters successfully written.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <sstream>

 int main()
 {
     std::ostringstream s1;
     std::streamsize sz = s1.rdbuf()->sputn("This is a test", 14);
     s1 << '\\n';
     std::cout << "The call to sputn() returned " << sz << '\\n'
               << "The output sequence contains " << s1.str();

     std::istringstream s2;
     sz = s2.rdbuf()->sputn("This is a test", 14);
     std::cout << "The call to sputn() on an input stream returned " << sz << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 The call to sputn() returned 14
 The output sequence contains This is a test
 The call to sputn() on an input stream returned 0
