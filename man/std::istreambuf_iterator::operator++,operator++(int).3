std::istreambuf_iterator::operator++,operator++(int) \- std::istreambuf_iterator::operator++,operator++(int)

.SH Synopsis
   istreambuf_iterator& operator++(); \fB(1)\fP
   /* unspecified */ operator++(int); \fB(2)\fP

   Advances the iterator by calling sbuf_->sbumpc() where sbuf_ is the stored pointer
   to the stream buffer.

   The behavior is undefined if the iterator is end-of-stream iterator.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   1) *this.
   2) An unspecified struct proxy holding the current character obtained via
   operator*() for later retrieval. proxy is implicitly convertible to CharT.
   proxy also holds a pointer to the stream buffer. istreambuf_iterator can be
   constructed from proxy, which is equivalent to constructing the istreambuf_iterator
   from the stream buffer pointer held by proxy.

.SH Exceptions

   \fI(none)\fP
