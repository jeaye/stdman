.TH std::condition_variable::notify_one 3 "Sep  4 2015" "2.0 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   void notify_one();  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   If any threads are waiting on *this, calling notify_one unblocks one of the waiting
   threads.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Exceptions

   noexcept specification:
   noexcept

.SH Notes

   The effects of notify_one()/notify_all() and wait()/wait_for()/wait_until() take
   place in a single total order, so it's impossible for notify_one() to, for example,
   be delayed and unblock a thread that started waiting just after the call to
   notify_one() was made.

   The notifying thread does not need to hold the lock on the same mutex as the one
   held by the waiting thread(s); in fact doing so is a pessimization, since the
   notified thread would immediately block again, waiting for the notifying thread to
   release the lock. However, some implementations (in particular many implementations
   of pthreads) recognize this situation and avoid this "hurry up and wait" scenario by
   transferring the waiting thread from the condition variable's queue directly to the
   queue of the mutex within the notify call, without waking it up.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <condition_variable>
 #include <thread>
 #include <chrono>

 std::condition_variable cv;
 std::mutex cv_m;
 int i = 0;
 bool done = false;

 void waits()
 {
     std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lk(cv_m);
     std::cout << "Waiting... \\n";
     cv.wait(lk, []{return i == 1;});
     std::cout << "...finished waiting. i == 1\\n";
     done = true;
 }

 void signals()
 {
     std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
     std::cout << "Notifying falsely...\\n";
     cv.notify_one(); // waiting thread is notified with i == 0.
                      // cv.wait wakes up, checks i, and goes back to waiting

     std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lk(cv_m);
     i = 1;
     while (!done)
     {
         std::cout << "Notifying true change...\\n";
         lk.unlock();
         cv.notify_one(); // waiting thread is notified with i == 1, cv.wait returns
         std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
         lk.lock();
     }
 }

 int main()
 {
     std::thread t1(waits), t2(signals);
     t1.join();
     t2.join();
 }

.SH Possible output:

 Waiting...
 Notifying falsely...
 Notifying true change...
 ...finished waiting. i == 1
