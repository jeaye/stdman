.TH std::ungetwc 3 "2018.03.28" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::ungetwc \- std::ungetwc

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cwchar>
   wint_t ungetwc( wint_t ch, std::FILE* stream );

   If ch does not equal WEOF, pushes the wide character ch into the input buffer
   associated with the stream stream in such a manner than subsequent read operation
   from stream will retrieve that wide character. The external device associated with
   the stream is not modified.

   Stream repositioning operations std::fseek, std::fsetpos, and std::rewind discard
   the effects of ungetwc.

   If ungetwc is called more than once without an intervening read or repositioning, it
   may fail (in other words, a pushback buffer of size 1 is guaranteed, but any larger
   buffer is implementation-defined). If multiple successful ungetwc were performed,
   read operations retrieve the pushed-back wide characters in reverse order of ungetwc

   If ch equals WEOF, the operation fails and the stream is not affected.

   A successful call to ungetwc clears the end of file status flag feof.

   A successful call to ungetwc on a stream (whether text or binary) modifies the
   stream position indicator in unspecified manner but guarantees that after all
   pushed-back wide characters are retrieved with a read operation, the stream position
   indicator is equal to its value before ungetwc.

.SH Parameters

   ch     - wide character to be put back
   stream - file stream to put the wide character back to

.SH Return value

   On success ch is returned.

   On failure WEOF is returned and the given stream remains unchanged.
