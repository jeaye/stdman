.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <queue>
   template<

   class T,
   class Container = std::vector<T>,
   class Compare = std::less<typename Container::value_type>

   > class priority_queue;

   A priority queue is a container adaptor that provides constant time lookup of the
   largest (by default) element, at the expense of logarithmic insertion and
   extraction.

   A user-provided Compare can be supplied to change the ordering, e.g. using
   std::greater<T> would cause the smallest element to appear as the top().

   Working with a priority_queue is similar to managing a heap in some random access
   container, with the benefit of not being able to accidentally invalidate the heap.

.SH Template parameters

   T         - The type of the stored elements.
               The type of the underlying container to use to store the elements. The
               container must satisfy the requirements of SequenceContainer.
               Additionally, it must provide the following functions with the usual
               semantics:

   Container -   * front()
                 * push_back()
                 * pop_back()

               The standard containers std::vector and std::deque satisfy these
               requirements.
   Compare   - A Compare type providing a strict weak ordering.

// Run this code

 #include <functional>
 #include <queue>
 #include <vector>
 #include <iostream>

 template<typename T> void print_queue(T& q) {
     while(!q.empty()) {
         std::cout << q.top() << " ";
         q.pop();
     }
     std::cout << '\\n';
 }

 int main() {

     for(int n : {1,8,5,6,3,4,0,9,3,2})
         q.push(n);
