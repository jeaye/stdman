   The class template basic_regex provides a general framework for holding regular
   expressions.

   Several specializations for common character types are provided:

   Value      Effect(s)
   icase      Character matching should be performed without regard to case.
              When performing matches, all marked sub-expressions (expr) are treated as
   nosubs     non-marking sub-expressions (?:expr). No matches are stored in the
              supplied std::regex_match structure and mark_count() is zero
              Instructs the regular expression engine to make matching faster, with the
   optimize   potential cost of making construction slower. For example, this might
              mean converting a non-deterministic FSA to a deterministic FSA.
   collate    Character ranges of the form "[a-b]" will be locale sensitive.
   ECMAScript Use the Modified ECMAScript regular expression grammar
   basic      Use the basic POSIX regular expression grammar (grammar documentation).
   extended   Use the extended POSIX regular expression grammar (grammar
              documentation).
   awk        Use the regular expression grammar used by the awk utility in POSIX
              (grammar documentation)
              Use the regular expression grammar used by the grep utility in POSIX.
   grep       This is effectively the same as the basic option with the addition of
              newline '\\n' as an alternation separator.
              Use the regular expression grammar used by the grep utility, with the -E
   egrep      option, in POSIX. This is effectively the same as the extended option
              with the addition of newline '\\n' as an alternation separator in addtion
              to '|'.

   At most one grammar option must be chosen out of ECMAScript, basic, extended, awk,
   grep, egrep. If no grammar is chosen, ECMAScript is assumed to be selected. The
   other options serve as modifiers, such that std::regex("meow", std::regex::icase) is
   equivalent to std::regex("meow", std::regex::ECMAScript|std::regex::icase)
