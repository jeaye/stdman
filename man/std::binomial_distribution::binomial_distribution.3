.SH NAME
std::binomial_distribution::binomial_distribution \- std::binomial_distribution::binomial_distribution

.SH Synopsis
   binomial_distribution() : binomial_distribution\fB(1)\fP {}        (1) \fI(since C++11)\fP
   explicit binomial_distribution( IntType t, double p = 0.5 ); \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   explicit binomial_distribution( const param_type& params );  \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Constructs a new distribution object.

   2) Uses t and p as the distribution parameters.
   3) Uses params as the distribution parameter.

.SH Parameters

   t      - the t distribution parameter (number of trials)
   p      - the p distribution parameter (probability of a trial generating true)
   params - the distribution parameter set

.SH Notes

   Requires that 0 ≤ p ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ t.
