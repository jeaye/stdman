.SH NAME
std::breakpoint_if_debugging \- std::breakpoint_if_debugging

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <debugging>
   void breakpoint_if_debugging() noexcept;  (since C++26)

   Conditional breakpoint: attempts to temporarily halt the execution of the program
   and transfer control to the debugger if it were able to determine that the debugger
   is present. Acts as a no-op otherwise.

   Formally, the behavior of this function is completely implementation-defined.
   Equivalent to if (std::is_debugger_present())
       std::breakpoint();.
