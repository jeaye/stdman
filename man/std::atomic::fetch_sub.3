   noexcept;                                                                      \fB(2)\fP

   volatile noexcept;

   Atomically replaces the current value with the result of arithmetic subtraction of
   the value and arg. The operation is read-modify-write operation. Memory is affected
   according to the value of order.

   For signed Integral types, arithmetic is defined to use two’s complement
   representation. There are no undefined results.

   For T* types, the result may be an undefined address, but the operation otherwise
   has no undefined behavior. The program is ill-formed if T is not an object type.

   For floating-point types, the floating-point environment in effect may
   be different from the calling thread's floating-point environment. The
   operation need not be conform to the corresponding std::numeric_limits
   traits but is encouraged to do so. If the result is not a
   representable value for its type, the result is unspecified but the    \fI(since C++20)\fP
   operation otherwise has no undefined behavior.

   The volatile-qualified versions are deprecated if
   std::atomic<T>::is_always_lock_free is false.

.SH Parameters

   arg   - the other argument of arithmetic subtraction
   order - memory order constraints to enforce

.SH Return value

   The value immediately preceding the effects of this function in the modification
   order of *this.
