   Atomically replaces the current value with the result of arithmetic subtraction of
   the value and arg. The operation is read-modify-write operation. Memory is affected
   according to the value of order.

   For signed Integral types, arithmetic is defined to use two’s complement
   representation. There are no undefined results. For T* types, the result may be an
   undefined address, but the operations otherwise have no undefined behavior.

.SH Parameters

   arg   - the other argument of arithmetic subtraction
   order - memory order constraints to enforce

.SH Return value

   The value immediately preceding the effects of this function in the modification
   order of *this.

.SH Exceptions

   noexcept specification:
