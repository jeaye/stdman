.SH NAME
std::filesystem::canonical,std::filesystem::weakly_canonical \- std::filesystem::canonical,std::filesystem::weakly_canonical

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <filesystem>
   path canonical( const std::filesystem::path& p );      \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   path canonical( const std::filesystem::path& p,        \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   std::error_code& ec );
   path weakly_canonical(const std::filesystem::path& p); \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   path weakly_canonical(const std::filesystem::path& p,  \fB(4)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   std::error_code& ec);

   1-2) Converts path p to a canonical absolute path, i.e. an absolute path that has no
   dot, dot-dot elements or symbolic links in its generic format representation. If p
   is not an absolute path, the function behaves as if it is first made absolute by
   std::filesystem::absolute(p). The path p must exist.
   3-4) Returns a path composed by operator/= from the result of calling canonical()
   with a path argument composed of the leading elements of p that exist (as determined
   by status(p) or status(p, ec)), if any, followed by the elements of p that do not
   exist. The resulting path is in normal form.

.SH Parameters

   p  - a path which may be absolute or relative; for canonical it must be an existing
        path
   ec - error code to store error status to

.SH Return value

   1-2) An absolute path that resolves to the same file as
   std::filesystem::absolute(p).
   3-4) A normal path of the form canonical(x)/y, where x is a path composed of the
   longest leading sequence of elements in p that exist, and y is a path composed of
   the remaining trailing non-existent elements of p

.SH Exceptions

   The overload that does not take a std::error_code& parameter throws
   filesystem::filesystem_error on underlying OS API errors, constructed with p as the
   first path argument and the OS error code as the error code argument. The overload
   taking a std::error_code& parameter sets it to the OS API error code if an OS API
   call fails, and executes ec.clear() if no errors occur. Any overload not marked
   noexcept may throw std::bad_alloc if memory allocation fails.

.SH Notes

   The function canonical() is modeled after the POSIX realpath.

   The function weakly_canonical() was introduced to simplify operational semantics of
   relative().

     // cleanup
     std::filesystem::current_path(old);
     const auto count = std::filesystem::remove_all(tmp / "a");
     std::cout << "Deleted " << count << " files or directories.\\n";
 }

.SH Possible output:

 Current path is "/tmp/a/b/c1/d"
 Canonical path for "../../c2/./e" is "/tmp/a/b/c2/e"
 Weakly canonical path for "../no-such-file" is "/tmp/a/b/c1/no-such-file"
 Canonical path for "../no-such-file" threw exception:
 filesystem error: in canonical: No such file or directory [../no-such-file] [/tmp/a/b/c1/d]
 Deleted 6 files or directories.
