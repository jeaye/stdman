.SH NAME
std::experimental::ranges::Copyable \- std::experimental::ranges::Copyable

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/ranges/concepts>
   template <class T>

   concept bool Copyable =
     ranges::CopyConstructible<T> &&                 (ranges TS)
     ranges::Movable<T> &&

     ranges::Assignable<T&, const T&>;

   The concept Copyable<T> specifies that T is an Movable object type that can also
   copied (that is, it supports copy construction and copy assignment).

.SH Notes

   It is intended that Copyable<T> also requires ranges::Assignable<T&, const T>
   (assignment from const rvalue) and ranges::Assignable<T&, T&> (assignment from
   non-const lvalue) to be satisfied.

.SH See also

   Movable specifies that an object of a type can be moved and swapped
