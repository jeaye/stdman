.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <system_error>
   class error_condition;            \fI(since C++11)\fP

   std::error_condition is a platform-independent error code. Like std::error_code, it
   is uniquely identified by an integer value and a std::error_category, but unlike
   std::error_code, the value is not platform-dependent.

   A typical implementation holds one integer data member (the value) and a pointer to
   an std::error_category.

   assign        replaces the contents
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
   clear         sets the error_condition to value 0 in generic_category
