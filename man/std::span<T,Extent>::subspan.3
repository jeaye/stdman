.SH Synopsis
   template< std::size_t Offset,

   std::size_t Count = std::dynamic_extent >                             \fB(1)\fP

   constexpr std::span<element_type, E /* see below */> subspan() const;
   constexpr std::span<element_type, std::dynamic_extent>

   subspan( std::size_t Offset,                                          \fB(2)\fP

   std::size_t Count = std::dynamic_extent ) const;

   Obtains a span that is a view over the Count elements of this span starting at
   offset Offset. If Count is std::dynamic_extent, the number of elements in the
   subspan is size() - offset (i.e., it ends at the end of *this.).

   The behavior is undefined if either Offset or Count is out of range. This happens if

     * Offset is greater than size();
     * Count is not std::dynamic_extent and Offset + Count is greater than size().

   The extent E of the span returned by \fB(1)\fP is determined as follows:

     * If Count is not std::dynamic_extent, Count;
     * Otherwise, if Extent is not std::dynamic_extent, Extent - Offset;
     * Otherwise, std::dynamic_extent.

.SH Return value

   The requested subspan r, such that r.data() == this->data() + Offset. If Count is
   std::dynamic_extent, r.size() == this->size() - Offset; otherwise r.size() == Count.
