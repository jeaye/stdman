.TH std::sample 3 "Nov 16 2016" "2.1 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::sample \- std::sample

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <algorithm>
   template< class PopulationIterator, class SampleIterator,

   class Distance, class UniformRandomBitGenerator >
   SampleIterator sample( PopulationIterator first, PopulationIterator    \fI(since C++17)\fP
   last,
   SampleIterator out, Distance n,

   UniformRandomBitGenerator&& g);

   Selects n elements from the sequence [first; last) such that each possible sample
   has equal probability of appearance, and writes those selected elements into the
   output iterator out. Random numbers are generated using the random number generator
   g.

   If n is greater than the number of elements in the sequence, selects last-first
   elements.

   The algorithm is stable only if PopulationIterator meets the requirements of
   ForwardIterator

.SH Parameters

   first, last           -          pair of iterators forming the range from which to
                                    make the sampling (the population)
   out                   -          the output iterator where the samples are written.
                                    Must not be in the [first;last) range
   n                     -          number of samples to make
   g                     -          the random number generator used as the source of
                                    randomness
   -
   PopulationIterator must meet the requirements of InputIterator.
   -
   SampleIterator must meet the requirements of OutputIterator.
   -
   SampleIterator must also meet the requirements of RandomAccessIterator if
   PopulationIterator doesn't meet ForwardIterator
   -
   PopulationIterator's value type must be writeable to out
   -
   Distance must be an integer type
   -
   std::remove_reference_t<UniformRandomBitGenerator> must meet the requirements of
   UniformRandomBitGenerator and its return type must be convertible to Distance

.SH Return value

   Returns a copy of out after the last sample that was output, that is, end of the
   sample range.

.SH Complexity

   Linear in std::distance(first,last)

.SH Notes

   This function may implement selection sampling or reservoir sampling.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <random>
 #include <string>
 #include <iterator>
 #include <algorithm>

 int main()
 {
     std::string in = "abcdefgh", out;
     std::sample(in.begin(), in.end(), std::back_inserter(out),
                 5, std::mt19937{std::random_device{}()});
     std::cout << "five random letters out of " << in << " : " << out << '\\n';
 }

.SH Possible output:

 five random letters out of abcdefgh : cdefg
