.TH std::sample 3 "2022.03.29" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::sample \- std::sample

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <algorithm>
   template< class PopulationIterator, class SampleIterator,

   class Distance, class URBG >
   SampleIterator sample( PopulationIterator first, PopulationIterator    \fI(since C++17)\fP
   last,
   SampleIterator out, Distance n,

   URBG&& g );

   Selects n elements from the sequence [first; last) (without replacement) such that
   each possible sample has equal probability of appearance, and writes those selected
   elements into the output iterator out. Random numbers are generated using the random
   number generator g.

   If n is greater than the number of elements in the sequence, selects last-first
   elements.

   The algorithm is stable (preserves the relative order of the selected elements) only
   if PopulationIterator meets the requirements of LegacyForwardIterator

   The behavior is undefined if out is in [first; last).

.SH Parameters

   first, last         -         pair of iterators forming the range from which to make
                                 the sampling (the population)
   out                 -         the output iterator where the samples are written
   n                   -         number of samples to make
   g                   -         the random number generator used as the source of
                                 randomness
.SH Type requirements
   -
   PopulationIterator must meet the requirements of LegacyInputIterator.
   -
   SampleIterator must meet the requirements of LegacyOutputIterator.
   -
   SampleIterator must also meet the requirements of LegacyRandomAccessIterator if
   PopulationIterator doesn't meet LegacyForwardIterator
   -
   PopulationIterator's value type must be writeable to out
   -
   Distance must be an integer type
   -
   std::remove_reference_t<URBG> must meet the requirements of
   UniformRandomBitGenerator and its return type must be convertible to Distance

.SH Return value

   Returns a copy of out after the last sample that was output, that is, end of the
   sample range.

.SH Complexity

   Linear in std::distance(first,last).

.SH Notes

   This function may implement selection sampling or reservoir sampling.

   Feature testing macro: __cpp_lib_sample

.SH Possible implementation

   See the implementations in libstdc++, libc++ and MSVC STL.

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <random>
 #include <string>
 #include <iterator>
 #include <algorithm>

 int main()
 {
     std::string in = "hgfedcba", out;
     std::sample(in.begin(), in.end(), std::back_inserter(out),
                 5, std::mt19937{std::random_device{}()});
     std::cout << "five random letters out of " << in << " : " << out << '\\n';
 }

.SH Possible output:

 five random letters out of hgfedcba: gfcba
