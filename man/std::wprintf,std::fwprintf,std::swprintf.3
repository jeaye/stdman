   Loads the data from the given locations, converts them to wide string equivalents
   and writes the results to a variety of sinks.

   1) Writes the results to stdout.
   2) Writes the results to a file stream stream.
   3) Writes the results to a wide string buffer. At most size-1 wide characters are
   written followed by null wide character.

.SH Parameters

stream - output file stream to write to
buffer - pointer to a wide character string to write to
size   - up to size - 1 characters may be written, plus the null terminator
         pointer to a null-terminated wide string specifying how to interpret the data.

         The format string consists of ordinary wide characters (except %), which are copied unchanged into the output
         stream, and conversion specifications. Each conversion specification has the following format:

               * introductory % character

               * (optional) one or more flags that modify the behavior of the conversion:

                       * -: the result of the conversion is left-justified within the field (by default it is
                         right-justified)
                       * +: the sign of signed conversions is always prepended to the result of the conversion (by
                         default the result is preceded by minus only when it is negative)
                       * space: if the result of a signed conversion does not start with a sign character, or is
                         empty, space is prepended to the result. It is ignored if + flag is present.
                       * # : alternative form of the conversion is performed. See the table below for exact effects
                         otherwise the behavior is undefined.
                       * 0 : for integer and floating point number conversions, leading zeros are used to pad the
                         field instead of space characters. For integer numbers it is ignored if the precision is
                         explicitly specified. For other conversions using this flag results in undefined behavior. It
                         is ignored if - flag is present.

               * (optional) integer value or * that specifies minimum field width. The result is padded with space
                 characters (by default), if required, on the left when right-justified, or on the right if
                 left-justified. In the case when * is used, the width is specified by an additional argument of type
                 int. If the value of the argument is negative, it results with the - flag specified and positive
                 field width. (Note: This is the minimum width: The value is never truncated.)

               * (optional) . followed by integer number or *, or neither that specifies precision of the conversion.
                 In the case when * is used, the precision is specified by an additional argument of type int. If the
                 value of this argument is negative, it is ignored. If neither a number nor * is used, the precision
                 is taken as zero. See the table below for exact effects of precision.

               * (optional) length modifier that specifies the size of the argument

               * conversion format specifier

         The following format specifiers are available:

                    a pointer.

         The floating point conversion functions convert infinity to inf or infinity. Which one is used is
         implementation defined.

         Not-a-number is converted to nan or nan(char_sequence). Which one is used is implementation defined.

         The conversions F, E, G, A output INF, INFINITY, NAN instead.

         Even though %c expects int argument, it is safe to pass a char because of the integer promotion that takes
         place when a variadic function is called.

         The correct conversion specifications for the fixed-width character types (int8_t, etc) are defined in the
         header <cinttypes>(C++) or <inttypes.h> (C) (although PRIdMAX, PRIuMAX, etc is synonymous with %jd, %ju,
         etc).

         The memory-writing conversion specifier %n is a common target of security exploits where format strings
         depend on user input and is not supported by the bounds-checked printf_s family of functions.

.SH Return value

   1,2) Number of wide characters written if successful or negative value if an error
   occurred.
   3) Number of wide characters written (not counting the terminating null wide
   character) if successful or negative value if an encoding error occurred or if the
   number of characters to be generated was equal or greater than size (including when
   size is zero)

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <locale>
 #include <clocale>
 #include <cwchar>

 int main()
 {
     char narrow_str[] = "z\\u00df\\u6c34\\U0001f34c";

                     // or "\\x7a\\xc3\\x9f\\xe6\\xb0\\xb4\\xf0\\x9f\\x8d\\x8c";
     wchar_t warr[29]; // the expected string is 28 characters plus 1 null terminator
     std::setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.utf8");

     std::swprintf(warr, sizeof warr/sizeof *warr,
