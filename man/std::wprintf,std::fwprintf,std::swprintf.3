   Loads the data from the given locations, converts them to wide string equivalents
   and writes the results to a variety of sinks.

   1) Writes the results to stdout.
   2) Writes the results to a file stream stream.
   3) Writes the results to a wide string buffer. At most size-1 wide characters are
   written. The resulting wide character string will be terminated with a null
   character, unless size is zero.

.SH Parameters

stream - output file stream to write to
buffer - pointer to a wide character string to write to
size   - up to size - 1 characters may be written, plus the null terminator
         pointer to a null-terminated wide string specifying how to interpret the data.

         The format string consists of ordinary characters (except %), which are copied unchanged into the output
         stream, and conversion specifications. Each conversion specification has the following format:

           * introductory % character

           * (optional) one or more flags that modify the behavior of the conversion:

           * -: the result of the conversion is left-justified within the field (by default it is
             right-justified)
           * +: the sign of signed conversions is always prepended to the result of the conversion (by default
             the result is preceded by minus only when it is negative)
           * space: if the result of a signed conversion does not start with a sign character, or is empty, space
             is prepended to the result. It is ignored if + flag is present.
           * # : alternative form of the conversion is performed. See the table below for exact effects.
           * 0 : for integer and floating point number conversions, leading zeros are used to pad the field
             instead of space characters. For floating point numbers it is ignored if the precision is explicitly
             specified. For other conversions using this flag results in undefined behavior. It is ignored if -
             flag is present.

           * (optional) integer value or * that specifies minimum field width. The result is padded with space
             characters (by default), if required, on the left when right-justified, or on the right if
             left-justified. In the case when * is used, the width is specified by an additional argument of type
             int. If the value of the argument is negative, it results with the - flag specified and positive
             field width.

           * (optional) . followed by integer number or * that specifies precision of the conversion. In the case
             when * is used, the precision is specified by an additional argument of type int. If the value of
             this argument is negative, it is ignored. See the table below for exact effects of precision.

           * (optional) length modifier that specifies the size of the argument

           * conversion format specifier

         The following format specifiers are available:

.SH Notes:

         The floating point conversion functions convert infinity to inf or infinity. Which one is used is
         implementation defined.
         Not-a-number is converted to nan or nan(char_sequence). Which one is used is implementation defined.
         The conversions F, E, G, A output INF, INFINITY, NAN instead.
         The correct conversion specifiers for the fixed-width character types (std:int8_t, etc) are defined in
         the header <cinttypes>
...    - arguments specifying data to print

.SH Return value

   Number of wide characters written if successful (not counting the terminating null
   character) or negative value if an error occurred.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <locale>
 #include <clocale>
 #include <cwchar>
  
 int main()
 {
     char narrow_str[] = "z\\u00df\\u6c34\\U0001f34c";
                     // or "zß水🍌"
                     // or "\\x7a\\xc3\\x9f\\xe6\\xb0\\xb4\\xf0\\x9f\\x8d\\x8c";
     wchar_t warr[30];
     std::setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.utf8");
  
     std::swprintf(warr, sizeof warr - 1,
                   L"Converted from UTF-8: '%s'", narrow_str);
  
     std::wcout.imbue(std::locale("en_US.utf8"));
     std::wcout << warr << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 Converted from UTF-8: 'zß水🍌'
