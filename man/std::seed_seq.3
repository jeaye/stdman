.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <random>
   class seed_seq;             \fI(since C++11)\fP

   std::seed_seq consumes a sequence of integer-valued data and produces a requested
   number of unsigned integer values i, 0 ≤ i < 232
   , based on the consumed data. The produced values are distributed over the entire
   32-bit range even if the consumed values are close.

   It provides a way to seed a large number of random number engines or to seed a
   generator that requires a lot of entropy, given a small seed or a poorly distributed
   initial seed sequence.

   std::seed_seq meets the requirements of SeedSequence.

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <random>
 #include <cstdint>
 #include <iostream>

 int main()
 {
     std::seed_seq seq{1,2,3,4,5};
     std::vector<std::uint32_t> seeds(10);
     seq.generate(seeds.begin(), seeds.end());
     for (std::uint32_t n : seeds) {
         std::cout << n << '\\n';
     }
 }
