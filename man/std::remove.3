.TH std::remove 3 "2022.03.29" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::remove \- std::remove

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstdio>
   int remove( const char* fname );

   Deletes the file identified by character string pointed to by fname.

   If the file is currently open by the current or another process, the behavior of
   this function is implementation-defined (in particular, POSIX systems unlink the
   file name, although the file system space is not reclaimed even if this was the last
   hardlink to the file until the last running process closes the file, Windows does
   not allow the file to be deleted)

.SH Parameters

   fname - pointer to a null-terminated string containing the path identifying the file
           to delete

.SH Return value

   0 upon success or non-zero value on error.

.SH Notes

   POSIX specifies many additional details for the behavior of this function.

   The standard library also defines a function template std::remove taking a pair of
   iterators and a value, this overload is one of the standard algorithms.

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <fstream>
 #include <cstdio>
 int main()
 {
     bool ok = static_cast<bool>(std::ofstream("file1.txt").put('a')); // create file
     if(!ok) { std::perror("Error creating file1.txt"); return 1; }
     std::cout << std::ifstream("file1.txt").rdbuf() << '\\n'; // print file

     std::remove("file1.txt"); // delete file

     bool failed = !std::ifstream("file1.txt");
     if(failed) { std::perror("Error opening deleted file"); return 1; }
 }

.SH Possible output:

 a
 Error opening deleted file: No such file or directory
