.SH Synopsis
   T exchange( T desired, std::memory_order order =
   std::memory_order_seq_cst );                                          \fI(since C++11)\fP
   T exchange( T desired, std::memory_order order =
   std::memory_order_seq_cst ) volatile;

   Atomically replaces the underlying value with desired. The operation is
   read-modify-write operation. Memory is affected according to the value of order.

.SH Parameters

   desired - value to assign
   order   - memory order constraints to enforce

.SH Return value

   The value of the atomic variable before the call.

.SH Exceptions

   noexcept specification:
