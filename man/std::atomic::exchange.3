.SH Synopsis
   T exchange( T desired, std::memory_order order =
   std::memory_order_seq_cst ) noexcept;                                 \fI(since C++11)\fP
   T exchange( T desired, std::memory_order order =
   std::memory_order_seq_cst ) volatile noexcept;

   read-modify-write operation. Memory is affected according to the value of order.

.SH Parameters
