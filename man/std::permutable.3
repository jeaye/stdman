.SH NAME
std::permutable \- std::permutable

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <iterator>
   template< class I >

   concept permutable =
       std::forward_iterator<I> &&             \fI(since C++20)\fP
       std::indirectly_movable_storable<I> &&

       std::indirectly_swappable<I>;

   The concept permutable refines std::forward_iterator by adding requirements for
   reordering through moves and swaps.

   Semantic requirements

   I models permutable only if all concepts it subsumes are modeled.
