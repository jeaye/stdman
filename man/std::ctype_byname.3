.TH std::ctype_byname 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <locale>
   template< class CharT >
   class ctype_byname : public std::ctype<CharT>;

   std::ctype_byname is a std::ctype facet which encapsulates character classification
   rules of the locale specified at its construction.

   Two specializations are provided by the standard library

   Defined in header <locale>
                              provides narrow character classification. This
   std::ctype_byname<char>    specialization uses table lookup for character
                              classification
   std::ctype_byname<wchar_t> provides wide character classification

.SH Member types

   Member type Definition
   mask        ctype<CharT>::mask

.SH Member functions

   constructor   constructs a new ctype_byname facet
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
   destructor    destroys a ctype_byname facet
                 \fI(protected member function)\fP

                             std::ctype_byname::ctype_byname

   explicit ctype_byname( const char* name, std::size_t refs = 0 );
   explicit ctype_byname( const std::string& name, std::size_t refs = 0   \fI(since C++11)\fP
   );

   Constructs a new std::ctype_byname facet for a locale with name.

   refs is used for resource management: if refs == 0, the implementation destroys the
   facet, when the last std::locale object holding it is destroyed. Otherwise, the
   object is not destroyed.

.SH Parameters

   name - the name of the locale
   refs - the number of references that link to the facet

                             std::ctype_byname::~ctype_byname

   protected:
   ~ctype_byname();

   Destroys the facet.

.SH Notes

   The explicit specialization std::ctype_byname<char> was listed as a separate entry
   in the header file <locale> until C++11. it was removed in C++11 as defect #1298,
   but it remains a required specialization, just like std::ctype_byname<wchar_t>.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <locale>

 int main()
 {
     wchar_t c = L'\\u00de'; // capital letter thorn

     std::locale loc("C");

     std::cout << "isupper('Þ', C locale) returned "
                << std::boolalpha << std::isupper(c, loc) << '\\n';

     loc = std::locale(loc, new std::ctype_byname<wchar_t>("en_US.utf8"));

     std::cout << "isupper('Þ', C locale with Unicode ctype) returned "
               << std::boolalpha << std::isupper(c, loc) << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 isupper('Þ', C locale) returned false
 isupper('Þ', C locale with Unicode ctype) returned true
