.TH std::gets 3 "2018.03.28" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::gets \- std::gets

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstdio>
   char* gets( char* str );    (deprecated in C++11)
                               (removed in C++14)

   Reads stdin into given character string until a newline character is found or
   end-of-file occurs.

.SH Parameters

   str - character string to be written

.SH Return value

   str on success, NULL on failure.

   If the failure has been caused by end of file condition, additionally sets the eof
   indicator (see std::feof()) on stdin. If the failure has been caused by some other
   error, sets the error indicator (see std::ferror()) on stdin.

.SH Notes

   The function provides no means to prevent buffer overflow of the destination array,
   given sufficiently long input string. std::gets was deprecated in C++11 and removed
   from C++14.

   std::fgets can be used instead.
