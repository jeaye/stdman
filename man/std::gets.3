.TH std::gets 3 "2022.07.31" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::gets \- std::gets

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstdio>
   char* gets( char* str );    (deprecated in C++11)
                               (removed in C++14)

   Reads stdin into given character string until a newline character is found or
   end-of-file occurs.

.SH Parameters

   str - character string to be written

.SH Return value

   str on success, a null pointer on failure.

   If the failure has been caused by end of file condition, additionally sets the eof
   indicator (see std::feof()) on stdin. If the failure has been caused by some other
   error, sets the error indicator (see std::ferror()) on stdin.

.SH Notes

   The function provides no means to prevent buffer overflow of the destination array,
   given sufficiently long input string. std::gets was deprecated in C++11 and removed
   from C++14.

   std::fgets can be used instead.
