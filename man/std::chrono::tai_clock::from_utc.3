.SH NAME
std::chrono::tai_clock::from_utc \- std::chrono::tai_clock::from_utc

.SH Synopsis
   template< class Duration >

   static std::chrono::tai_time<std::common_type_t<Duration,              \fI(since C++20)\fP
   std::chrono::seconds>>

       from_utc( const std::chrono::utc_time<Duration>& ) noexcept;

   Converts the utc_time t to a tai_time representing the same point in time.

.SH Return value

   A std::chrono::tai_time representing the same point in time as t, computed as if by
   constructing a value of the return type from t.time_since_epoch() and adding
   378691210s (378691210 is the number of seconds between the epochs of the two clocks:
   1958-01-01 00:00:00 TAI and 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC).
