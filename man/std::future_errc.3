.TH std::future_errc 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <future>
   enum class future_errc {

   broken_promise = /* implementation-defined */,
   future_already_retrieved = /* implementation-defined */,   \fI(since C++11)\fP
   promise_already_satisfied = /* implementation-defined */,
   no_state = /* implementation-defined */

   };

   The scoped enumeration std::future_errc defines the error codes reported by
   std::future and related classes in std::future_error exception objects. Only four
   error codes are required, although the implementation may define additional error
   codes. Because the appropriate specialization of std::is_error_code_enum is
   provided, values of type std::future_errc are implicitly convertible to
   std::error_code.

   All error codes are distinct and non-zero.

.SH Member constants

   Constant                  Explanation
   broken_promise            the asynchronous task abandoned its shared state
   future_already_retrieved  the contents of shared state were already accessed through
                             std::future
   promise_already_satisfied attempt to store a value in the shared state twice
   no_state                  attempt to access std::promise or std::future without an
                             associated shared state

.SH Non-member functions

   make_error_code(std::future_errc)      constructs a future error code
   \fI(C++11)\fP                                \fI(function)\fP
   make_error_condition(std::future_errc) constructs a future error_condition
   \fI(C++11)\fP                                \fI(function)\fP

.SH Helper classes

   is_error_code_enum<std::future_errc> extends the type trait std::is_error_code_enum
   \fI(C++11)\fP                              to identify future error codes
                                        \fI(class template)\fP

.SH Notes

   In C++11, broken_promise was specified to equal zero despite
   std::error_code/std::error_condition using zero to mean "no error". This was fixed
   in LWG issue @2056 for C++14.
