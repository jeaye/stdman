.SH NAME
std::locale::id::id \- std::locale::id::id

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <locale>
   id();                      \fB(1)\fP
   id(const id&) = delete;    \fB(2)\fP

   1) default constructor: creates an object of type std::locale::id with
   implementation-specific content.

   2) copy constructor is deleted; std::locale::id is not copyable.

.SH Notes

   Because locales and facets must be available for the IO stream objects with static
   storage duration, such as std::cout, typical implementations let implicit default
   constructor zero-initialize the contents of std::locale::id during static
   initialization (before constructors run for static objects), and when a facet is
   added to any locale for the first time, the locale completes initialization of the
   facet's id.
