   Constructs the pseudo-random number engine.

   1) Default constructor. Seeds the engine with default_seed.
   2) Constructs the engine and initializes the state (n values X
   i of type result_type) as follows: value mod 2w
   is used to initialize X
   0 and the rest are initialized iteratively, for i=1-n,...,-1, each X
   i is initialized to [f·(X
   i-1xor(X
   i-1rshift(w-2)))+i mod n] mod 2w
   3) Constructs the engine and initializes the state by calling s.generate(a, a+n*k)
   where a is an array of length n*k and k is ceil(w/32) and then, iteratively for
   i=-n,...,-1, setting each element of the engine state X
   i to (Σk-1
   j=0a
   k(i+n)+j}·232j
   ) mod 2w
   , and finally if the most significant w-r bits of X
   0 are zero, and if all other X
   i are zero, replacing X
   0 with 2w-1
   .

   Note: initialization requirements are based on the 2002 version of Mersenne Twister,
   mt19937ar.c

   The overload \fB(3)\fP only participates in overload resolution if Sseq qualifies as a
   SeedSequence. In particular, it is excluded from the set of candidate functions if
   Sseq is convertible to result_type.

.SH Parameters

   value - seed value to use in the initialization of the internal state
   s     - seed sequence to use in the initialization of the internal state

.SH Complexity

   linear in n (the state size)
