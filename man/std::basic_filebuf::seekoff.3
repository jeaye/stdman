.SH NAME
std::basic_filebuf::seekoff \- std::basic_filebuf::seekoff

.SH Synopsis
   protected:

   virtual pos_type seekoff( off_type off,
   std::ios_base::seekdir dir,

   std::ios_base::openmode which = std::ios_base::in | std::ios_base::out );

   Repositions the file pointer, if possible, to the position that corresponds to
   exactly off characters from beginning, end, or current position of the file
   (depending on the value of dir.

   If the associated file is not open (is_open()==false, fails immediately.

   If the multibyte character encoding is state-dependent (codecvt::encoding() returned
   -1) or variable-length (codecvt::encoding() returned 0) and the offset off is not
   0, fails immediately: this function cannot determine the number of bytes that
   correspond to off characters.

   If dir is not std::basic_ios::cur or the offset off is not 0, and the most resent
   operation done on this filebuf object was output (that is, either the put buffer is
   not empty, or the most recently called function was overflow()), then calls
   std::codecvt::unshift to determine the unshift sequence necessary, and writes that
   sequence to the file by calling overflow().

   Then converts the argument dir to a value whence of type int as follows:

   value of dir        value of whence
   std::basic_ios::beg SEEK_SET
   std::basic_ios::end SEEK_END
   std::basic_ios::cur SEEK_CUR

   Then, if the character encoding is fixed-width (codecvt::encoding() returns some
   positive number width, moves the file pointer as if by std::fseek(file, width*off,
   whence).

   Otherwise, moves the file pointer as if by std::fseek(file, 0, whence).

   The openmode argument, required by the base class function signature, is usually
   ignored, because std::basic_filebuf maintains only one file position.

.SH Parameters

   off   - relative position to set the position indicator to.
           defines base position to apply the relative offset to. It can be one of the
           following constants:

   dir   - Constant Explanation
           beg      the beginning of a stream
           end      the ending of a stream
           cur      the current position of stream position indicator
           defines which of the input and/or output sequences to affect. It can be one
           or a combination of the following constants:
   which -
           Constant Explanation
           in       affect the input sequence
           out      affect the output sequence

.SH Return value

   A newly constructed object of type pos_type which stores the resulting file
   position, or pos_type(off_type(-1)) on failure.

.SH Notes

   seekoff() is called by std::basic_streambuf::pubseekoff, which is called by
   std::basic_istream::seekg, std::basic_ostream::seekp, std::basic_istream::tellg, and
   std::basic_ostream::tellp

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <fstream>
 #include <locale>
 int main()
 {
     // prepare a 10-byte file holding 4 characters in UTF8
     std::ofstream("text.txt") << u8"z\\u00df\\u6c34\\U0001d10b"; // or u8"zß水𝄋"
                                            // or "\\x7a\\xc3\\x9f\\xe6\\xb0\\xb4\\xf0\\x9d\\x84\\x8b";

     // open using a non-converting encoding
     std::ifstream f1("text.txt");
     std::cout << "f1's locale's encoding() returns "
               << std::use_facet<std::codecvt<char, char, std::mbstate_t>>(f1.getloc()).encoding() << '\\n'
               << "pubseekoff(3, beg) returns " << f1.rdbuf()->pubseekoff(3, std::ios_base::beg) << '\\n'
               << "pubseekoff(0, end) returns " << f1.rdbuf()->pubseekoff(0, std::ios_base::end) << '\\n';;

     // open using UTF-8
     std::wifstream f2("text.txt");
     f2.imbue(std::locale("en_US.UTF-8"));
     std::cout << "f2's locale's encoding() returns "
               << std::use_facet<std::codecvt<wchar_t, char, std::mbstate_t>>(f2.getloc()).encoding() << '\\n'
               << "pubseekoff(3, beg) returns " << f2.rdbuf()->pubseekoff(3, std::ios_base::beg) << '\\n'
               << "pubseekoff(0, end) returns " << f2.rdbuf()->pubseekoff(0, std::ios_base::end) << '\\n';

 }

.SH Output:

 f1's locale's encoding() returns 1
 pubseekoff(3, beg) returns 3
 pubseekoff(0, end) returns 10
 f2's locale's encoding() returns 0
 pubseekoff(3, beg) returns -1
 pubseekoff(0, end) returns 10
