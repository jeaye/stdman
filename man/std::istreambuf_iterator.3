   class istreambuf_iterator;

   std::istreambuf_iterator is a single-pass input iterator that reads successive
   characters from the std::basic_streambuf object for which it was constructed. The
   actual read operation is performed when the iterator is incremented, not when it is
   dereferenced. The first character may be read when the iterator is constructed or
   when the first dereferencing is done. Otherwise, dereferencing only returns a copy
   of the most recently read character.

   The default-constructed std::istreambuf_iterator is known as the end-of-stream
   iterator. When a valid std::istreambuf_iterator reaches the end of the underlying
   stream, it becomes equal to the end-of-stream iterator. Dereferencing or
   incrementing it further invokes undefined behavior.

   std::istreambuf_iterator has a trivial copy constructor, a constexpr default
   constructor, and a trivial destructor.

.SH Member types

   Member type       Definition
   value_type        CharT
   difference_type   Traits::off_type
   pointer           /* unspecified, usually CharT* */
   reference         CharT
   iterator_category std::input_iterator_tag

   Note: before C++17, these member types are required to be obtained by inheriting
   from std::iterator<std::input_iterator_tag,CharT,Traits::off_type,/* unspecified,
   usually CharT* */,CharT>.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <vector>
 #include <sstream>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <iterator>

 int main()
 {
     // typical use case: an input stream represented as a pair of iterators
     std::istringstream in("Hello, world");
     std::vector<char> v( (std::istreambuf_iterator<char>(in)),
                           std::istreambuf_iterator<char>() );
     std::cout << "v has " << v.size() << " bytes. ";
     v.push_back('\\0');
     std::cout << "it holds \\"" << &v[0] << "\\"\\n";


     // demonstration of the single-pass nature
     std::istringstream s("abc");
     std::istreambuf_iterator<char> i1(s), i2(s);
     std::cout << "i1 returns " << *i1 << '\\n'
               << "i2 returns " << *i2 << '\\n';
     ++i1;
     std::cout << "after incrementing i1, but not i2\\n"
               << "i1 returns " << *i1 << '\\n'
               << "i2 returns " << *i2 << '\\n';
     ++i2; // this makes the apparent value of *i2 to jump from 'a' to 'c'
     std::cout << "after incrementing i2, but not i1\\n"
               << "i1 returns " << *i1 << '\\n'
               << "i2 returns " << *i2 << '\\n';

 }

.SH Output:

 v has 12 bytes. it holds "Hello, world"
 i1 returns a
 i2 returns a
 after incrementing i1, but not i2
 i1 returns b
 i2 returns a
 after incrementing i2, but not i1
 i1 returns b
 i2 returns c
