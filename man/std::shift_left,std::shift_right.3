   ForwardIt last,

   typename std::iterator_traits<ForwardIt>::difference_type n );

   Shifts the elements in the range [first, last) by n positions.

   1) Shifts the elements towards the beginning of the range. If n <= 0 || n >= last -
   first, there are no effects. Otherwise, for every integer i in [0, last - first -
   n), moves the element originally at position first + n + i to position first + i.
   The moves are performed in increasing order of i starting from 0.
   3) Shifts the elements towards the end of the range. If n <= 0 || n >= last - first,
   there are no effects. Otherwise, for every integer i in [0, last - first - n), moves
   the element originally at position first + i to position first + n + i. If ForwardIt
   meets the LegacyBidirectionalIterator requirements, then the moves are performed in
   decreasing order of i starting from last - first - n - 1.
   2,4) Same as \fB(1)\fP and \fB(3)\fP, respectively, but executed according to policy and the
   moves may be performed in any order. These overloads does not participate in
   overload resolution unless std::is_execution_policy_v<std::decay_t<ExecutionPolicy>>
   is true.

   Elements that are in the original range but not the new range are left in a valid
   but unspecified state.

.SH Parameters

   first               -             the beginning of the original range
   last                -             the end of the original range
   n                   -             the number of positions to shift
   policy              -             the execution policy to use. See execution policy
                                     for details.
.SH Type requirements
   -
   ForwardIt must meet the requirements of LegacyForwardIterator.
   -
   ForwardIt must meet either the requirements of LegacyBidirectionalIterator or the
   requirements of ValueSwappable for overloads (3-4).
   -
   The type of dereferenced ForwardIt must meet the requirements of MoveAssignable.

.SH Return value

   1-2) The end of the resulting range. If n is positive and less than last - first,
   returns first + (last - first - n). Otherwise if n is positive, returns first.
   Otherwise, returns last.
   3-4) The beginning of the resulting range. If n is positive and less than last -
   first, returns first + n. Otherwise if n is positive, returns last. Otherwise,
   returns first.

.SH Complexity

   1-2) At most std::distance(first, last) - n assignments.
   3-4) At most std::distance(first, last) - n assignment or swaps.

.SH Exceptions

   The overloads with a template parameter named ExecutionPolicy report errors as
   follows:

     * If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws an exception
       and ExecutionPolicy is one of the standard policies, std::terminate is called.
       For any other ExecutionPolicy, the behavior is implementation-defined.
     * If the algorithm fails to allocate memory, std::bad_alloc is thrown.
