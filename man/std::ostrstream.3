.TH std::ostrstream 3 "Nov 25 2015" "2.0 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::ostrstream \- std::ostrstream

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <strstream>
   class ostrstream : public std::ostream  \fB(deprecated)\fP

   The class ostrstream implements output operations on array-backed streams. It
   essentially wraps a raw array I/O device implementation (std::strstreambuf) into the
   higher-level interface of std::basic_ostream.

   The typical implementation of ostrstream holds only one non-derived data member: an
   object of type std::strstreambuf.

.SH Notes

   After any call to str(), a call to freeze(false) is required to allow the destructor
   to deallocate the buffer as necessary.

   ostrstream has been deprecated since C++98, std::ostringstream and
   boost::iostreams::array_sink are the recommended replacements.
