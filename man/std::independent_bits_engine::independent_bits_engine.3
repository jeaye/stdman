   Constructs new pseudo-random engine adaptor.

   1) Default constructor. The underlying engine is also default-constructed.
   2) Constructs the underlying engine with s.
   3) Constructs the underlying engine with seed sequence seq. This constructor only
   participate in overload resolution if Sseq qualifies as a SeedSequence. In
   particular, this constructor does not participate in overload resolution if Sseq is
   implicitly convertible to result_type.
   4) Constructs the underlying engine with a copy of e.
   5) Move-constructs the underlying engine with e. e holds unspecified, but valid
   state afterwards.

.SH Parameters

   s   - integer value to construct the underlying engine with
   seq - seed sequence to construct the underlying engine with
   e   - pseudo-random number engine to initialize with
