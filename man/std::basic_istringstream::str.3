.SH NAME
std::basic_istringstream::str \- std::basic_istringstream::str

.SH Synopsis
   std::basic_string<CharT,Traits,Allocator> str() const;              \fB(1)\fP
   void str(const std::basic_string<CharT,Traits,Allocator>& new_str); \fB(2)\fP

   Manages the contents of the underlying string object.

   1) Returns a copy of the underlying string as if by calling rdbuf()->str().

   2) Replaces the contents of the underlying string as if by calling
   rdbuf()->str(new_str).

.SH Parameters

   new_str - new contents of the underlying string

.SH Return value

   1) a copy of the underlying string object.

   2) \fI(none)\fP

.SH Notes

   The copy of the underlying string returned by str is a temporary object that will be
   destructed at the end of the expression, so directly calling c_str() on the result
   of str() (for example in auto *ptr = out.str().c_str();) results in a dangling
   pointer.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <sstream>
 #include <iostream>
 int main()
 {
     int n;
  
     std::istringstream in;  // could also use in("1 2")
     in.str("1 2");
     in >> n;
     std::cout << "after reading the first int from \\"1 2\\", the int is "
               << n << ", str() = \\"" << in.str() << "\\"\\n";
  
     std::ostringstream out("1 2");
     out << 3;
     std::cout << "after writing the int '3' to output stream \\"1 2\\""
               << ", str() = \\"" << out.str() << "\\"\\n";
  
     std::ostringstream ate("1 2", std::ios_base::ate);
     ate << 3;
     std::cout << "after writing the int '3' to append stream \\"1 2\\""
               << ", str() = \\"" << ate.str() << "\\"\\n";
 }

.SH Output:

 after reading the first int from "1 2", the int is 1, str() = "1 2"
 after writing the int '3' to output stream "1 2", str() = "3 2"
 after writing the int '3' to append stream "1 2", str() = "1 23"
