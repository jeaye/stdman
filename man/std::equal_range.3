   equal_range( ForwardIt first, ForwardIt last,

   const T& value, Compare comp );

   Returns a range containing all elements equivalent to value in the range [first,
   last).

   The range [first, last) must be at least partially ordered with respect to value,
   i.e. it must satisfy all of the following requirements:

     * partitioned with respect to element < value or comp(element, value) (that is,
       all elements for which the expression is true precedes all elements for which
       the expression is false)
     * partitioned with respect to !(value < element) or !comp(value, element)
     * for all elements, if element < value or comp(element, value) is true then
       !(value < element) or !comp(value, element) is also true

   A fully-sorted range meets these criteria.

   The returned range is defined by two iterators, one pointing to the first element
   that is not less than value and another pointing to the first element greater than
   value. The first iterator may be alternatively obtained with std::lower_bound(), the
   second - with std::upper_bound().

   The first version uses operator< to compare the elements, the second version uses
   the given comparison function comp.

.SH Parameters

   first, last - the range of elements to examine
   value       - value to compare the elements to
                 binary predicate which returns true if the first argument is less
                 than (i.e. is ordered before) the second.

                 The signature of the predicate function should be equivalent to the
                 following:

                 bool pred(const Type1 &a, const Type2 &b);

   comp        - While the signature does not need to have const &, the function must
                 not modify the objects passed to it and must be able to accept all
                 values of type (possibly const) Type1 and Type2 regardless of value
                 category (thus, Type1 & is not allowed
                 , nor is Type1 unless for Type1 a move is equivalent to a copy
                 \fI(since C++11)\fP).
                 The types Type1 and Type2 must be such that an object of type T can be
                 implicitly converted to both Type1 and Type2, and an object of type
                 ForwardIt can be dereferenced and then implicitly converted to both
                 Type1 and Type2. 
.SH Type requirements
   -
   ForwardIt must meet the requirements of LegacyForwardIterator.
   -
   Compare must meet the requirements of BinaryPredicate. it is not required to satisfy
   Compare

.SH Return value

   std::pair containing a pair of iterators defining the wanted range, the first
   pointing to the first element that is not less than value and the second pointing to
   the first element greater than value.

   If there are no elements not less than value, last is returned as the first element.
   Similarly if there are no elements greater than value, last is returned as the
   second element

.SH Complexity

   The number of comparisons performed is logarithmic in the distance between first and
   last (At most 2 * log
   2(last - first) + O(1) comparisons). However, for non-LegacyRandomAccessIterators,
   the number of iterator increments is linear.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <algorithm>
 #include <vector>
 #include <iostream>

 struct S
 {
     int number;
     char name;
     // note: name is ignored by this comparison operator
     bool operator< ( const S& s ) const { return number < s.number; }
 };

 int main()
 {
     // note: not ordered, only partitioned w.r.t. S defined below
     std::vector<S> vec = { {1,'A'}, {2,'B'}, {2,'C'}, {2,'D'}, {4,'G'}, {3,'F'} };

     S value = {2, '?'};

     auto p = std::equal_range(vec.begin(), vec.end(), value);

     for ( auto i = p.first; i != p.second; ++i )
         std::cout << i->name << ' ';


     // heterogeneous comparison:
     struct Comp
     {
         bool operator() ( const S& s, int i ) const { return s.number < i; }
         bool operator() ( int i, const S& s ) const { return i < s.number; }
     };

     auto p2 = std::equal_range(vec.begin(),vec.end(), 2, Comp{});

     for ( auto i = p2.first; i != p2.second; ++i )
         std::cout << i->name << ' ';
 }
