.SH NAME
std::experimental::ranges::SignedIntegral \- std::experimental::ranges::SignedIntegral

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/ranges/concepts>
   template < class T >                                                    (ranges TS)
   concept bool SignedIntegral = Integral<T> && std::is_signed<T>::value;

   The concept SignedIntegral<T> is satisfied if and only if T is an integral type and
   std::is_signed<T>::value is true.

   There need not be any subsumption relationship between SignedIntegral<T> and
   std::is_signed<T>::value.

.SH Notes

   SignedIntegral<T> may be satisfied by a type that is not a signed integer type, for
   example, char (on a system where char is signed).
