.SH NAME
std::basic_ios::setstate \- std::basic_ios::setstate

.SH Synopsis
   void setstate( iostate state );

   Sets the stream error flags state in addition to currently set flags. Essentially
   calls clear(rdstate() | state). May throw an exception.

.SH Parameters

           stream error state flags to set. It can be a combination of the following
           constants:

   state - Constant Explanation
           goodbit  no error
           badbit   irrecoverable stream error
           failbit  input/output operation failed (formatting or extraction error)
           eofbit   associated input sequence has reached end-of-file

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <sstream>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::ostringstream stream;
  
     if (!stream.fail()) {
         std::cout << "stream is not fail\\n";
     }
  
     stream.setstate(std::ios_base::failbit);
  
     if (stream.fail()) {
         std::cout << "now stream is fail\\n";
     }
  
     if (!stream.good()) {
         std::cout << "and stream is not good\\n";
     }
 }

.SH Output:

 stream is not fail
 now stream is fail
 and stream is not good
