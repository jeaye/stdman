.SH NAME
std::execution::sync_wait \- std::execution::sync_wait

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <execution>
   auto sync_wait( execution::sender auto sender )

       requires (/*always-sends-some-values*/(sender))               (since C++26)

           -> std::optional<std::tuple</*value-sent-by*/(sender)>>;

.SH Parameters

   sender - sender upon which the completion of sync_wait is blocked

.SH Return value

   Returns an optional tuple of values that were sent by the provided sender on its
   completion of work.

.SH Notes

   The sender returned by sync_wait similarly to ensure_started, except that it blocks
   the current std::thread or thread of main until the work is completed.

.SH See also

                  Eagerly starts a sender, returning a sender that will deliver the
                  results to a receiver to which it is connected and started, if any.
                  When the result sender is not connected to a receiver, or if the
   ensure_started resulting operation state is not started, the results are ignored. If
                  such a sender is destroyed before the underlying operation completes,
                  the operation continues running detached.
