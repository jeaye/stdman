std::length_error \- std::length_error

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <stdexcept>
   class length_error;

   Defines a type of object to be thrown as exception. It reports errors that result
   from attempts to exceed implementation defined length limits for some object.

   This exception is thrown by member functions of std::basic_string and
   std::vector::reserve

.SH Member functions

   constructor   constructs the exception object
                 \fI(public member function)\fP 

   

std::length_error::length_error

   explicit length_error( const std::string& what_arg ); \fB(1)\fP
   explicit length_error( const char* what_arg );        \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Constructs the exception object with what_arg as explanatory string that can be
   accessed through what().

   Because copying std::exception is not permitted to throw exceptions, this message is
   typically stored internally as a separately-allocated reference-counted string. This
   is also why there is no constructor taking std::string&&: it would have to copy the
   content anyway.

.SH Parameters

   what_arg - explanatory string

.SH Exceptions

   May throw std::bad_alloc

Inherited from std::exception
