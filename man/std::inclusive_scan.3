   Computes an inclusive prefix sum operation using binary_op (or std::plus<>() for
   overloads (1-2)) for the range [first, last), using init as the initial value (if
   provided), and writes the results to the range beginning at d_first. "inclusive"
   means that the i-th input element is included in the i-th sum.

   Formally, assigns through each iterator i in [d_first, d_first + (last - first)) the
   value of:

     * for overloads (1-4), the generalized noncommutative sum of *j... for every j in
       [first, first + (i - d_first + 1)) over binary_op
     * for overloads (5-6), the generalized noncommutative sum of init, *j... for every
       j in [first, first + (i - d_first + 1)) over binary_op

   where generalized noncommutative sum GNSUM(op, a
   1, ..., a
   N) is defined as follows:

     * if N=1, a
       1
     * if N > 1, op(GNSUM(op, a
       1, ..., a
       K), GNSUM(op, a
       M, ..., a
       N)) for any K where 1 < K+1 = M ≤ N

   In other words, the summation operations may be performed in arbitrary order, and
   the behavior is nondeterministic if binary_op is not associative.

   Overloads (2,4,6) are executed according to policy. This overload only participates
   in overload resolution if std::is_execution_policy_v<std::decay_t<ExecutionPolicy>>
   is true.

   binary_op shall not invalidate iterators (including the end iterators) or subranges,
   nor modify elements in the ranges [first, last) or [d_first, d_first + (last -
   first)). Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

.SH Parameters

   first, last          -        the range of elements to sum
   d_first              -        the beginning of the destination range; may be equal
                                 to first
   policy               -        the execution policy to use. See execution policy for
                                 details.
   init                 -        the initial value (optional)
                                 binary FunctionObject that will be applied in to the
   binary_op            -        result of dereferencing the input iterators, the
                                 results of other binary_op, and init (if provided).
.SH Type requirements
   -
   InputIt must meet the requirements of InputIterator.
   -
   OutputIt must meet the requirements of OutputIterator.
   -
   ForwardIt1 must meet the requirements of ForwardIterator. and, if init is not
   provided, ForwardIt1's value_type must be MoveConstructible and binary_op(*first,
   *first) must be convertible to ForwardIt1's value type
   -
   ForwardIt2 must meet the requirements of ForwardIterator.
   -
   T (if init is provided) must meet the requirements of MoveConstructible. All of
   binary_op(init, *first), binary_op(init, init), and binary_op(*first, *first) must
   be convertible to T

.SH Return value

   Iterator to the element past the last element written.

.SH Complexity

   O(last - first) applications of the binary operation

.SH Exceptions

   The overloads with a template parameter named ExecutionPolicy report errors as
   follows:

     * If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws an exception
       and ExecutionPolicy is one of the three standard policies, std::terminate is
       called. For any other ExecutionPolicy, the behavior is implementation-defined.
     * If the algorithm fails to allocate memory, std::bad_alloc is thrown.
