.SH NAME
std::chi_squared_distribution \- std::chi_squared_distribution

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <random>
   template< class RealType = double >  \fI(since C++11)\fP
   class chi_squared_distribution;

   The chi_squared_distribution produces random numbers x>0 according to the
   Chi-squared distribution:

           f(x;n) =

           x(n/2)-1
           e^-x/2
           Γ(n/2) 2n/2

   Γ is the Gamma function (See also std::tgamma) and n are the degrees of freedom
   (default 1).

   std::chi_squared_distribution satisfies all requirements of RandomNumberDistribution

.SH Template parameters

   RealType - The result type generated by the generator. The effect is undefined if
              this is not one of float, double, or long double.

.SH Member types

   Member type Definition
   result_type RealType
   param_type  the type of the parameter set, see RandomNumberDistribution.

.SH Member functions

   constructor   constructs new distribution
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
   reset         resets the internal state of the distribution
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
.SH Generation
   operator()    generates the next random number in the distribution
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
.SH Characteristics
   n             returns the degrees of freedom (n) distribution parameter
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
   param         gets or sets the distribution parameter object
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
   min           returns the minimum potentially generated value
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
   max           returns the maximum potentially generated value
                 \fI(public member function)\fP

.SH Non-member functions

   operator== compares two distribution objects
   operator!= \fI(function)\fP
   operator<< performs stream input and output on pseudo-random number distribution
   operator>> \fI(function template)\fP
