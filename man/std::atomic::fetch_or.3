.SH Synopsis
   T fetch_or( T arg,
   std::memory_order order =                          \fI(since C++11)\fP
   std::memory_order_seq_cst );                       (member only of atomic<Integral>
   T fetch_or( T arg,                                 template specialization)
   std::memory_order order =
   std::memory_order_seq_cst ) volatile;

   Atomically replaces the current value with the result of bitwise OR of the value and
   arg. The operation is read-modify-write operation. Memory is affected according to
   the value of order.

.SH Parameters

   arg   - the other argument of bitwise OR
   order - memory order constraints to enforce

.SH Return value

   The value immediately preceding the effects of this function in the modification
   order of *this.

.SH Exceptions

   noexcept specification:
   noexcept
