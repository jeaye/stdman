   Constructs a new iterator adaptor.

   1) Default constructor. The underlying iterator is value-initialized. Operations on
   the resulting iterator have defined behavior if and only if the corresponding
   operations on a value-initialized Iter also have defined behavior.
   2) The underlying iterator is initialized with x.
   3) The underlying iterator is initialized with that of other.
   This overload participates in overload resolution only if U is not the same type as
   Iter and std::convertible_to<const U&, Iter> is modeled
   \fI(since C++20)\fP.

.SH Parameters

   x     - iterator to adapt
   other - iterator adaptor to copy
