.TH std::call_once 3 "Apr  2 2017" "2.1 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::call_once \- std::call_once

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <mutex>
   template< class Callable, class... Args >                              \fI(since C++11)\fP
   void call_once( std::once_flag& flag, Callable&& f, Args&&... args );

   Executes the Callable object f exactly once, even if called from several threads.

   Each group of call_once invocations that receives the same std::once_flag object
   will meet the following requirements:

     * Exactly one execution of exactly one of the functions (passed as f to the
       invocations in the group) is performed. It is undefined which function will be
       selected for execution. The selected function runs in the same thread as the
       call_once invocation it was passed to.

     * No invocation in the group returns before the abovementioned execution of the
       selected function is completed successfully, that is, doesn't exit via an
       exception.

     * If the selected function exits via exception, it is propagated to the caller.
       Another function is then selected and executed.

.SH Parameters

   flag    - an object, for which exactly one function gets executed
   f       - Callable object to invoke
   args... - arguments to pass to the function

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Exceptions

     * std::system_error if any condition prevents calls to call_once from executing as
       specified
     * any exception thrown by f

.SH Notes

   The arguments to the Callable object are moved or copied by value. If
   a reference argument needs to be passed to the Callable object, it has \fI(until C++17)\fP
   to be wrapped (e.g. with std::ref or std::cref).
   The arguments to the Callable object are perfect forwarded (as if by
   std::forward<Callable>(f) and std::forward<Args>(args))...), which is
   different from the uses of Callables in the thread constructor or      \fI(since C++17)\fP
   std::async, because call_once does not have to transfer its arguments
   to another thread of execution, and therefore does not need to move or
   copy.

   Initialization of function-local statics is guaranteed to occur only once even when
   called from multiple threads, and may be more efficient than the equivalent code
   using std::call_once.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <thread>
 #include <mutex>

 std::once_flag flag1, flag2;

 void simple_do_once()
 {
     std::call_once(flag1, [](){ std::cout << "Simple example: called once\\n"; });
 }

 void may_throw_function(bool do_throw)
 {
   if (do_throw) {
     std::cout << "throw: call_once will retry\\n"; // this may appear more than once
     throw std::exception();
   }
   std::cout << "Didn't throw, call_once will not attempt again\\n"; // guaranteed once
 }

 void do_once(bool do_throw)
 {
   try {
     std::call_once(flag2, may_throw_function, do_throw);
   }
   catch (...) {
   }
 }

 int main()
 {
     std::thread st1(simple_do_once);
     std::thread st2(simple_do_once);
     std::thread st3(simple_do_once);
     std::thread st4(simple_do_once);
     st1.join();
     st2.join();
     st3.join();
     st4.join();

     std::thread t1(do_once, true);
     std::thread t2(do_once, true);
     std::thread t3(do_once, false);
     std::thread t4(do_once, true);
     t1.join();
     t2.join();
     t3.join();
     t4.join();
 }

.SH Possible output:

 Simple example: called once
 throw: call_once will retry
 throw: call_once will retry
 Didn't throw, call_once will not attempt again
