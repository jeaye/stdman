// Run this code

 #include <memory>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <cassert>
  
 struct Foo {
     Foo() { std::cout << "Foo\\n"; }
     ~Foo() { std::cout << "~Foo\\n"; }
 };
  
 int main()
 {
     std::cout << "Creating new Foo...\\n";
     std::unique_ptr<Foo> up(new Foo());
  
     std::cout << "About to release Foo...\\n";
     Foo* fp = up.release();
  
     assert (up.get() == nullptr);
     std::cout << "Foo is no longer owned by unique_ptr...\\n";
  
     delete fp;
 }
