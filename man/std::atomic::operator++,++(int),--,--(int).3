   Atomically increments or decrements the current value. The operation is
   read-modify-write operation.

   1) Performs atomic pre-increment. Equivalent to fetch_add\fB(1)\fP+1.
   2) Performs atomic post-increment. Equivalent to fetch_add\fB(1)\fP.
   3) Performs atomic pre-decrement. Equivalent to fetch_sub\fB(1)\fP-1
   4) Performs atomic post-decrement. Equivalent to fetch_sub\fB(1)\fP.

   For signed Integral types, arithmetic is defined to use two’s complement
   representation. There are no undefined results. For T* types, the result may be an
   undefined address, but the operations otherwise have no undefined behavior.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   1,3) The value of the atomic variable after the modification. Formally, the result
   of incrementing/decrementing the value immediately preceding the effects of this
   function in the modification order of *this.
   2,4) The value of the atomic variable before the modification. Formally, the value
   immediately preceding the effects of this function in the modification order of
   *this.

.SH Exceptions

   noexcept specification:
   noexcept

.SH Notes

   Unlike most pre-increment and pre-decrement operators, the pre-increment and
   pre-decrement operators for atomic types do not return a reference to the modified
   object. They return a copy of the stored value instead.

              atomically adds the argument to the value stored in the atomic object and
   fetch_add  obtains the value held previously
              \fI(public member function)\fP
              atomically subtracts the argument from the value stored in the atomic
   fetch_sub  object and obtains the value held previously
              \fI(public member function)\fP
   operator+=
   operator-= adds, subtracts, or performs bitwise AND, OR, XOR with the atomic value
   operator&= \fI(public member function)\fP
