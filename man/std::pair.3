.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <utility>
   template<

   class T1,
   class T2

   > struct pair;

   std::pair is a class template that provides a way to store two heterogeneous objects
   as a single unit. A pair is a specific case of a std::tuple with two elements.

   If neither T1 nor T2 is a possibly cv-qualified class type with non-trivial
   destructor, or array thereof, the destructor of pair is trivial.

.SH Template parameters

   T1, T2 - the types of the elements that the pair stores.
