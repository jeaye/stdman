.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <utility>
   template<

       class T1,
       class T2

   > struct pair;

   std::pair is a struct template that provides a way to store two heterogeneous
   objects as a single unit. A pair is a specific case of a std::tuple with two
   elements.

.SH Template parameters

   T1, T2 - the types of the elements that the pair stores.

.SH Member types

   Member type Definition
   first_type  T1
   second_type T2

.SH Member objects

   Member name Type
   first       T1
   second      T2

.SH Member functions
