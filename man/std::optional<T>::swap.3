.SH NAME
std::optional<T>::swap \- std::optional<T>::swap

.SH Synopsis
   void swap( optional& other ) noexcept(/* see below */);  \fI(since C++17)\fP

   Swaps the contents with those of other.

     * If neither *this nor other contain a value, the function has no effect.

     * If only one of *this and other contains a value (let's call this object in and
       the other un), the contained value of un is direct-initialized from
       std::move(*in), followed by destruction of the contained value of in as if by
       in->T::~T(). After this call, in does not contain a value; un contains a value.

     * If both *this and other contain values, the contained values are exchanged by
       calling using std::swap; swap(**this, *other). T lvalues must satisfy Swappable.

.SH Parameters

   other - the optional object to exchange the contents with

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Exceptions

   noexcept specification:
   noexcept(std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<T> &&
   std::is_nothrow_swappable_v<T>)

   In the case of thrown exception, the states of the contained values of *this and
   other are determined by the exception safety guarantees of swap of type T or T's
   move constructor, whichever is called. For both *this and other, if the object
   contained a value, it is left containing a value, and the other way round.
