.TH std::ostrstream::freeze 3 "Nov 25 2015" "2.0 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::ostrstream::freeze \- std::ostrstream::freeze

.SH Synopsis
   void freeze(bool flag = true);

   If the stream is using a dynamically-allocated array for output, disables (flag ==
   true) or enables (flag == false) automatic allocation/deallocation of the buffer.
   Effectively calls rdbuf()->freeze(flag)

.SH Notes

   After a call to str(), dynamic streams become frozen automatically. A call to
   freeze(false) is required before exiting the scope in which this ostrstream object
   was created. otherwise the destructor will leak memory. Also, additional output to a
   frozen stream may be truncated once it reaches the end of the allocated buffer.

.SH Parameters

   flag - desired status

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <strstream>
 #include <iostream>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::ostrstream dyn; // dynamically-allocated output buffer
     dyn << "Test: " << 1.23;
     std::cout << "The output stream contains \\"" << dyn.str() << "\\"\\n";
     // the stream is now frozen due to str()
     dyn << " More text"; // output to a frozen stream may be truncated
     std::cout << "The output stream contains \\"" << dyn.str() << "\\"\\n\\n";
     dyn.freeze(false); // freeze(false) must be called or the  destructor will leak
  
     std::ostrstream dyn2; // dynamically-allocated output buffer
     dyn2 << "Test: " << 1.23;
     std::cout << "The output stream contains \\"" << dyn2.str() << "\\"\\n";
     dyn2.freeze(false);   // unfreeze the stream after str()
     dyn2 << " More text"; // output will not be truncated (the underlying buffer may grow)
     std::cout << "The output stream contains \\"" << dyn2.str() << "\\"\\n";
     dyn2.freeze(false); // freeze(false) must be called or the  destructor will leak
 }

.SH Possible output:

 The output stream contains "Test: 1.23"
 The output stream contains "Test: 1.23 More "
  
 The output stream contains "Test: 1.23"
 The output stream contains "Test: 1.23 More text"
