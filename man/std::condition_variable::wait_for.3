.SH NAME
std::condition_variable::wait_for \- std::condition_variable::wait_for

.SH Synopsis
   template< class Rep, class Period >

   std::cv_status wait_for( std::unique_lock<std::mutex>& lock, \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   const std::chrono::duration<Rep, Period>& rel_time);
   template< class Rep, class Period, class Predicate >

   bool wait_for( std::unique_lock<std::mutex>& lock,           \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   const std::chrono::duration<Rep, Period>& rel_time,

   Predicate pred);

   1) Atomically releases lock, blocks the current executing thread, and adds it to the
   list of threads waiting on *this. The thread will be unblocked when notify_all() or
   notify_one() is executed, or when the relative timeout rel_time expires. It may also
   be unblocked spuriously. When unblocked, regardless of the reason, lock is
   reacquired and wait_for() exits.
   If this function exits via exception, lock is also reacquired.
   \fI(until C++14)\fP
   2) Equivalent to return wait_until(lock, std::chrono::steady_clock::now() +
   rel_time, std::move(pred));. This overload may be used to ignore spurious
   awakenings.

   A steady clock is used to measure the duration. This function may block for longer
   than timeout_duration due to scheduling or resource contention delays.

   Calling this function if lock.mutex() is not locked by the current thread is
   undefined behavior.

   Calling this function if lock.mutex() is not the same mutex as the one used by all
   other threads that are currently waiting on the same condition variable is undefined
   behavior.

   If these functions fail to meet the postcondition
   (lock.owns_lock()==true and lock.mutex() is locked by the calling      \fI(since C++14)\fP
   thread), std::terminate is called. For example, this could happen if
   relocking the mutex throws an exception,

.SH Parameters

   lock     - an object of type std::unique_lock<std::mutex>, which must be locked by
              the current thread
   rel_time - an object of type std::chrono::duration representing the maximum time to
              spend waiting
              predicate which returns false if the waiting should be continued.

   pred     - The signature of the predicate function should be equivalent to the
              following:

              bool pred();

.SH Return value

   1) std::cv_status::timeout if the relative timeout specified by rel_time expired,
   std::cv_status::no_timeout otherwise.
   2) false if the predicate pred still evaluates to false after the rel_time timeout
   expired, otherwise true.

.SH Exceptions

   1)

   May throw std::system_error, may also propagate exceptions thrown by   \fI(until C++14)\fP
   lock.lock() or lock.unlock().
   Any exception thrown by clock, time_point, or duration during the
   execution (clocks, time points, and durations provided by the standard \fI(since C++14)\fP
   library never throw)

   2) Same as \fB(1)\fP but may also propagate exceptions thrown by pred

.SH Notes

   Even if notified under lock, overload \fB(1)\fP makes no guarantees about the state of the
   associated predicate when returning due to timeout.

   The effects of notify_one()/notify_all() and each of the three atomic parts of
   wait()/wait_for()/wait_until() (unlock+wait, wakeup, and lock) take place in a
   single total order that can be viewed as modification order of an atomic variable:
   the order is specific to this individual condition_variable. This makes it
   impossible for notify_one() to, for example, be delayed and unblock a thread that
   started waiting just after the call to notify_one() was made.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <atomic>
 #include <condition_variable>
 #include <thread>
 #include <chrono>

 std::condition_variable cv;
 std::mutex cv_m;
 int i;

 void waits(int idx)
 {
     std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lk(cv_m);
     if(cv.wait_for(lk, std::chrono::milliseconds(idx*100), [](){return i == 1;}))
         std::cerr << "Thread " << idx << " finished waiting. i == " << i << '\\n';
     else
         std::cerr << "Thread " << idx << " timed out. i == " << i << '\\n';
 }

 void signals()
 {
     std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(120));
     std::cerr << "Notifying...\\n";
     cv.notify_all();
     std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));
     {
         std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lk(cv_m);
         i = 1;
     }
     std::cerr << "Notifying again...\\n";
     cv.notify_all();
 }

 int main()
 {
     std::thread t1(waits, 1), t2(waits, 2), t3(waits, 3), t4(signals);
     t1.join(); t2.join(), t3.join(), t4.join();
 }

.SH Output:

 Thread 1 timed out. i == 0
 Notifying...
 Thread 2 timed out. i == 0
 Notifying again...
 Thread 3 finished waiting. i == 1
