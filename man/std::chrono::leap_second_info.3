std::chrono::leap_second_info \- std::chrono::leap_second_info

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <chrono>
   struct leap_second_info {

   bool is_leap_second;           \fI(since C++20)\fP
   std::chrono::seconds elapsed;

   };

   A leap_second_info indicates whether a UTC time is during a positive leap second
   insertion and the total number of leap seconds between 1 January 1970 and the UTC
   time.

   leap_second_info has no base classes or members other than is_leap_second, elapsed,
   and implicitly declared special member functions.
