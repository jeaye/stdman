.SH Synopsis
   void pop_front();

   Removes the first element of the container. If there are no elements in the
   container, the behavior is undefined.

   Iterators and references to the erased element are invalidated. If the element is
   the last element in the container, the end() iterator is also invalidated. Other
   references and iterators are not affected.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Complexity

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <deque>
 #include <iostream>

 int main()
 {
     std::deque<char> chars{'A', 'B', 'C', 'D'};

     for (; !chars.empty(); chars.pop_front())
         std::cout << "chars.front(): '" << chars.front() << "'\\n";
 }

 chars.front(): 'B'
 chars.front(): 'C'
