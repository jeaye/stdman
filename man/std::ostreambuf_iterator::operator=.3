.SH Synopsis
   ostreambuf_iterator& operator=( CharT c )

   If failed() returns true, inserts the character c into the associated stream buffer
   by calling pbuf->sputc(c), where pbuf is the private member of type streambuf_type*.
   Otherwise, does nothing.

   If the call to pbuf->sputc(c) returns Traits::eof, sets the failed() flag to true.
