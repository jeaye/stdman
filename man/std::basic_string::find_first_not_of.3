   Finds the first character equal to none of the characters in the given character
   sequence. The search considers only the interval [pos, size()). If the character is
   not present in the interval, npos will be returned.

   1) Finds the first character equal to none of characters in str.
   2) Finds the first character equal to none of characters in the first count
   characters of the character string pointed to by s. s can include null characters.
   3) Finds the first character equal to none of characters in character string pointed
   to by s. The length of the string is determined by the first null character.
   4) Finds the first character not equal to ch.
   5) Finds the first character equal to none of characters in sv.

   In all cases, equality is checked by calling Traits::eq.

.SH Parameters

   str   - string identifying characters to search for
   pos   - position for the seach to start from
   count - length of character string identifying characters to search for
   s     - pointer to a character string identifying characters to search for
   ch    - character identifying characters to search for
   sv    - std::basic_string_view identifying the characters to search for

.SH Return value

   Position of the found character or npos if no such character is found.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <string>
 #include <iostream>
  
 int main() {
     std::string to_search = "Some data with %MACROS to substitute";
  
     std::cout << "Before: " << to_search << '\\n';
  
     auto pos = std::string::npos;
     while ((pos = to_search.find('%')) != std::string::npos) {
         // Permit uppercase letters, lowercase letters and numbers in macro names
         const auto after = to_search.find_first_not_of("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789", pos + 1);
  
         // Now to_search[pos] == '%' and to_search[after] == ' ' (after the 'S')
  
         if(after != std::string::npos)
             to_search.replace(pos, after - pos, "some very nice macros");
     }
  
     std::cout << "After: " << to_search << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 Before: Some data with %MACROS to substitute
 After: Some data with some very nice macros to substitute
