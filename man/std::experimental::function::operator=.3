.SH Synopsis
   function& operator=( const function& other );       \fB(1)\fP (library fundamentals TS)
   function& operator=( function&& other );            \fB(2)\fP (library fundamentals TS)
   function& operator=( std::nullptr_t );              \fB(3)\fP (library fundamentals TS)
   template< class F >                                 \fB(4)\fP (library fundamentals TS)
   function& operator=( F&& f );
   template< class F >                                 \fB(5)\fP (library fundamentals TS)
   function& operator=( std::reference_wrapper<F> f );

   Assigns a new target to std::experimental::function. In the description below, let
   ALLOCATOR_OF(f) be the allocator specified in the construction of f, or
   std::allocator<char>() if no allocator was specified.

   1) Assigns a copy of target of other, as if by executing
   function(std::allocator_arg, ALLOCATOR_OF(*this), other).swap(*this);
   2) Moves the target of other to *this, as if by executing
   function(std::allocator_arg, ALLOCATOR_OF(*this), std::move(other)).swap(*this);.
   other is in a valid state with an unspecified value.
   3) Destroys the target of *this. *this is empty after the call. The memory resource
   returned by get_memory_resource() after the assignment is equivalent to the memory
   resource before the assignment, but the address may change.
   4) Sets the target of *this to the callable f, as if by executing
   function(std::allocator_arg, ALLOCATOR_OF(*this),std::forward<F>(f)).swap(*this);.
   This operator does not participate in overload resolution unless f is Callable for
   argument types Args... and return type R.
   5) Sets the target of *this to a copy of f, as if by executing
   function(std::allocator_arg, ALLOCATOR_OF(*this), f).swap(*this);

.SH Parameters

   other - another std::experimental::function object to copy or move from
   f     - a callable to initialize the target with
.SH Type requirements
   -
   F must meet the requirements of Callable.

.SH Return value

   *this
