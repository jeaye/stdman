.SH NAME
std::experimental::ranges::identity \- std::experimental::ranges::identity

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/ranges/functional>
   struct identity;                                    (ranges TS)

   ranges::identity is a function object type whose operator() returns its argument
   unchanged. It is used as the default projection for all Ranges TS algorithms.

.SH Member types

   Member type    Definition
   is_transparent /* unspecified */

.SH Member functions

   operator() returns the argument unchanged
              \fI(public member function)\fP

std::experimental::ranges::identity::operator()

   template< class T>
   constexpr T&& operator()( T&& t ) const noexcept;

   Returns std::forward<T>(t).

.SH Parameters

   t - argument to return

.SH Return value

   std::forward<T>(t).

.SH Notes

   The member type is_transparent indicates to the caller that this function object is
   a transparent function object: it accepts arguments of arbitrary types and uses
   perfect forwarding, which avoids unnecessary copying and conversion when the
   function object is used in heterogeneous context, or with rvalue arguments. In
   particular, template functions such as std::set::find and std::set::lower_bound make
   use of this member type on their Compare types.
