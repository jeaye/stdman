   Unordered set is an associative container that contains a set of unique objects of
   type Key. Search, insertion, and removal have average constant-time complexity.

   Internally, the elements are not sorted in any particular order, but organized into
   buckets. Which bucket an element is placed into depends entirely on the hash of its
   value. This allows fast access to individual elements, since once a hash is
   computed, it refers to the exact bucket the element is placed into.

   Container elements may not be modified (even by non const iterators) since
   modification could change an element's hash and corrupt the container.

   std::unordered_set meets the requirements of Container, AllocatorAwareContainer,
   UnorderedAssociativeContainer.

  Iterator invalidation

                  Operations                        Invalidated
   All read only operations, swap, std::swap Never
   clear, rehash, reserve, operator=         Always
   insert, emplace, emplace_hint             Only if causes rehash
   erase                                     Only to the element erased

.SH Notes

     * The swap functions do not invalidate any of the iterators inside the container,
       but they do invalidate the iterator marking the end of the swap region.

     * References and pointers to data stored in the container are only invalidated by
       erasing that element, even when the corresponding iterator is invalidated.

     * After container move assignment, unless elementwise move assignment is forced by
       incompatible allocators, references, pointers, and iterators (other than the end
       iterator) to moved-from container remain valid, but refer to elements that are
       now in *this.

.SH Notes

   The member types iterator and const_iterator may be aliases to the same type. This
   means defining a pair of function overloads using the two types as parameter types
   may violate the One Definition Rule. Since iterator is convertible to
   const_iterator, a single function with a const_iterator as parameter type will work
   instead.
