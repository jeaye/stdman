   Unordered set is an associative container that contains a set of unique objects of
   type Key. Search, insertion, and removal have average constant-time complexity.

   Internally, the elements are not sorted in any particular order, but organized into
   buckets. Which bucket an element is placed into depends entirely on the hash of its
   value. This allows fast access to individual elements, since once a hash is
   computed, it refers to the exact bucket the element is placed into.

   Container elements may not be modified (even by non const iterators) since
   modification could change an element's hash and corrupt the container.

   std::unordered_set meets the requirements of Container, AllocatorAwareContainer,
   UnorderedAssociativeContainer.

.SH Notes

   The member types iterator and const_iterator may be aliases to the same type. Since
   iterator is convertible to const_iterator, const_iterator should be used in function
   parameter lists to avoid violations of the One Definition Rule.
