std::money_get \- std::money_get

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <locale>
   template<

       class CharT,
       class InputIt = std::istreambuf_iterator<CharT>

   > class money_get;

   Class template std::money_get encapsulates the rules for parsing monetary values
   from character streams. The standard I/O manipulator std::get_money uses the
   std::money_get facet of the I/O stream's locale.

   If a std::money_get specialization is not guaranteed to be provided by the standard
   library (see below), the behaviors of its get() and do_get() are not guaranteed as
   specified.

.SH Specializations

   The standard library is guaranteed to provide the following specializations (they
   are required to be implemented by any locale object):

   Defined in header <locale>
   std::money_get<char>    parses narrow string representations of monetary values
   std::money_get<wchar_t> parses wide string representations of monetary values

   In addition, the standard library is also guaranteed to provide every specialization
   that satisfies the following type requirements:

     * CharT is one of
          * char,
          * wchar_t, and
          * any other implementation-defined character container type that meets the
            requirements for a character on which any of the iostream components can be
            instantiated; and
     * InputIt must meet the requirements of LegacyInputIterator.

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <iomanip>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <iterator>
 #include <locale>
 #include <sstream>

 int main()
 {
     std::string str = "$1.11 $2.22 $3.33";
     std::cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(2);

     std::cout << '\\"' << str << "\\" parsed with the I/O manipulator: ";
     std::istringstream s1(str);
     s1.imbue(std::locale("en_US.UTF-8"));

     long double val;
     while (s1 >> std::get_money(val))
         std::cout << val / 100 << ' ';
     std::cout << '\\n';

     str = "USD  1,234.56";
     std::cout << '\\"' << str << "\\" parsed with the facet directly: ";
     std::istringstream s2(str);
     s2.imbue(std::locale("en_US.UTF-8"));

     auto& f = std::use_facet<std::money_get<char>>(s2.getloc());
     std::ios_base::iostate err;
     std::istreambuf_iterator<char> beg(s2), end;
     f.get(beg, end, true, s2, err, val);

     std::cout << val / 100 << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 "$1.11 $2.22 $3.33" parsed with the I/O manipulator: 1.11 2.22 3.33
 "USD  1,234.56" parsed with the facet directly: 1234.56
