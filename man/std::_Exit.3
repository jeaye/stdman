.TH std::_Exit 3 "Jun 28 2014" "2.0 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstdlib>
   [[noreturn]] void _Exit( int exit_code );  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Causes normal program termination to occur without completely cleaning the
   resources.

   Destructors of variables with automatic, thread local and static storage durations
   are not called. Functions passed to std::at_quick_exit() or std::atexit() are not
   called. Whether open resources such as files are closed is implementation defined.
   If exit_code is EXIT_FAILURE, an implementation-defined status, indicating
   unsuccessful termination, is returned. In other cases implementation-defined status
   value is returned.

.SH Parameters

   exit_code - exit status of the program

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Exceptions

   \fI(none)\fP                    \fI(until C++11)\fP
   noexcept specification:  
   noexcept                  \fI(since C++11)\fP
     

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
  
 class Static {
 public:
     ~Static()
     {
         std::cout << "Static dtor\\n";
     }
 };
  
 class Local {
 public:
     ~Local()
     {
         std::cout << "Local dtor\\n";
     }
 };
  
 Static static_variable; // dtor of this object will *not* be called
  
 void atexit_handler()
 {
     std::cout << "atexit handler\\n";
 }
  
 int main()
 {
     Local local_variable; // dtor of this object will *not* be called
  
     // handler will *not* be called
     const int result = std::atexit(atexit_handler);
  
     if (result != 0) {
         std::cerr << "atexit registration failed\\n";
         return EXIT_FAILURE;
     }
  
     std::cout << "test" << std::endl; // flush from std::endl
         // needs to be here, otherwise nothing will be printed
     std::_Exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
 }

.SH Output:
