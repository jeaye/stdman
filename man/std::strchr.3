.SH NAME
std::strchr \- std::strchr

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstring>
   const char* strchr( const char* str, int ch );
       char* strchr(       char* str, int ch );

   Finds the first occurrence of the character static_cast<char>(ch) in the byte string
   pointed to by str.

   The terminating null character is considered to be a part of the string.

.SH Parameters

   str - pointer to the null-terminated byte string to be analyzed
   ch  - character to search for

.SH Return value

   Pointer to the found character in str, or a null pointer if no such character is
   found.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <cstring>
  
 int main()
 {
   const char *str = "Try not. Do, or do not. There is no try.";
   char target = 'T';
   const char *result = str;
  
   while ((result = std::strchr(result, target)) != NULL) {
     std::cout << "Found '" << target
               << "' starting at '" << result << "'\\n";
  
     // Increment result, otherwise we'll find target at the same location
     ++result;
   }
 }

.SH Output:

 Found 'T' starting at 'Try not. Do, or do not. There is no try.'
 Found 'T' starting at 'There is no try.'
