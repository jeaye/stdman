.SH NAME
std::basic_string::reserve \- std::basic_string::reserve

.SH Synopsis
   void reserve( size_type new_cap = 0 );

   Informs a std::basic_string object of a planned change in size, so that it can
   manage the storage allocation appropriately.

     * If new_cap is greater than the current capacity(), new storage is allocated, and
       capacity() is made equal or greater than new_cap.

     * If new_cap is less than the current capacity(), this is a non-binding shrink
       request.

     * If new_cap is less than the current size(), this is a non-binding shrink-to-fit
       request
       equivalent to shrink_to_fit()
       \fI(since C++11)\fP.

   If a capacity change takes place, all iterators and references, including the
   past-the-end iterator, are invalidated.

.SH Parameters

   new_cap - new capacity of the string

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Exceptions

   Throws std::length_error if new_cap is greater than max_size()

   May throw any exceptions thrown by std::allocator_traits<Allocator>::allocate(),
   such as std::bad_alloc.

.SH Complexity

   At most linear in the size() of the string

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <cassert>
 #include <string>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::string s;
     std::string::size_type new_capacity{ 100u };
     assert(new_capacity > s.capacity());
  
     s.reserve(new_capacity);
     assert(new_capacity <= s.capacity());
 }

            returns the number of characters that can be held in currently allocated
   capacity storage
