.SH NAME
std::get_pointer_safety \- std::get_pointer_safety

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <memory>
   std::pointer_safety get_pointer_safety() noexcept;  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Obtains the implementation-defined pointer safety model, which is a value of type
   std::pointer_safety.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   The pointer safety used by this implementation.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <memory>

 int main()
 {
     std::cout << "Pointer safety: ";
     switch (std::get_pointer_safety()) {
         case std::pointer_safety::strict:    std::cout << "strict\\n"; break;
         case std::pointer_safety::preferred: std::cout << "preferred\\n"; break;
         case std::pointer_safety::relaxed:   std::cout << "relaxed\\n"; break;
     }
 }

.SH Possible output:

 Pointer safety: relaxed
