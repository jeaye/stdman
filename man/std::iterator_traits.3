.SH NAME
std::iterator_traits \- std::iterator_traits

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <iterator>
   template< std::input_iterator I >

   requires /* see below */
   struct iterator_traits<std::counted_iterator<I>> :
   std::iterator_traits<I> {                                              \fI(since C++20)\fP
   using pointer = std::conditional_t<std::contiguous_iterator<I>,
   std::add_pointer_t<std::iter_reference_t<I>>,
   void>;

   };

   Inherits the properties from customized (generated from either a standard partial
   specialization or a program-defined specialization) std::iterator_traits<I>, with
   the member type pointer adjusted, where I models input_iterator.

   Notably, the iterator_concept (if present) and iterator_category are inherited from
   std::iterator_traits<I>.

   The condition in the requires-clause is true if and only if std::iterator_traits<I>
   is not generated from the primary template.

.SH Note

   Before P2259R1, this specialization is used even if std::iterator_traits<I> is
   generated from the primary template. As a result, when testing
   std::counted_iterator<I> against an iterator concept (e.g. forward_iterator), the
   determination of /*ITER_CONCEPT*/ does not take I::iterator_concept into account,
   and thus std::counted_iterator<I> sometimes erroneously behaves as if it cannot
   model that concept. This incorrect behavior is implemented in libstdc++ prior to
   10.4, and in MSVC STL prior to VS 2022 17.0 Preview 3.

   The standard library provides partial specializations of std::iterator_traits for
   pointer types, std::counted_iterator, and std::common_iterator.

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <iterator>
 #include <type_traits>
 #include <list>
 #include <vector>

 int main() {
     std::vector v{1,2,3,4};
     std::list l{1,2,3,4};
     std::counted_iterator iv{v.begin(), 3};
     std::counted_iterator il{l.begin(), 3};
     static_assert(std::is_same<int*, std::iterator_traits<decltype(iv)>::pointer>());
     static_assert(std::is_same<void, std::iterator_traits<decltype(il)>::pointer>());
 }
