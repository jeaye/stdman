.TH std::collate_byname 3 "Jun 28 2014" "2.0 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <locale>
   template< class CharT >
   class collate_byname : public std::collate<CharT>;

   std::collate_byname is a std::collate facet which encapsulates locale-specific
   collation (comparison) and hashing of strings. Just like std::collate, it can be
   imbued in std::regex and applied, by means of std::locale::operator(), directly to
   all standard algorithms that expect a string comparison predicate.

   Two specializations are provided by the standard library

   Defined in header <locale>
   std::collate_byname<char>    locale-specific collation of multibyte strings
   std::collate_byname<wchar_t> locale-specific collation of wide strings

.SH Member functions

   constructor   constructs a new collate_byname facet
                 \fI(public member function)\fP 
   destructor    destroys a collate_byname facet
                 \fI(protected member function)\fP 

   

                           std::collate_byname::collate_byname

   explicit collate_byname( const char* name, std::size_t refs = 0 );
   explicit collate_byname( const std::string& name, std::size_t refs =   \fI(since C++11)\fP
   0 );

   Constructs a new std::collate_byname facet for a locale with name.

   refs is used for resource management: if refs == 0, the implementation destroys the
   facet, when the last std::locale object holding it is destroyed. Otherwise, the
   object is not destroyed.

.SH Parameters

   name - the name of the locale
   refs - the number of references that link to the facet

   

                           std::collate_byname::~collate_byname

   protected:
   ~collate_byname();

   Destroys the facet.

.SH Protected member functions

   do_compare   compares two strings using this facet's collation rules
   \fB[virtual]\fP    \fI(virtual protected member function of std::collate)\fP 
   do_transform transforms a string so that collation can be replaced by comparison

   do_hash      generates an integer hash value using this facet's collation rules
   \fB[virtual]\fP    \fI(virtual protected member function of std::collate)\fP 

.SH Notes

   Collation order is the dictionary order: the position of the letter in the national
   alphabet (its equivalence class) has higher priority than its case or variant.
   Within an equivalence class, lowercase characters collate before their uppercase
   equivalents and locale-specific order may apply to the characters with diacritics.
   In some locales, groups of characters compare as single collation units. For
   example, "ch" in Czech follows "h" and precedes "i", and "dzs" in Hungarian follows
   "dz" and precedes "g".
