   public:

   iter_type put( iter_type out, std::ios_base& str,            \fB(1)\fP
   char_type fill, const std::tm* t,

   const CharT* fmtbeg, const CharT* fmtend ) const;
   public:

   iter_type put( iter_type out, std::ios_base& str,            \fB(2)\fP
   char_type fill, const std::tm* t,

   char format, char modifier = 0 ) const;
   protected:

   virtual iter_type do_put( iter_type out, std::ios_base& str, \fB(3)\fP
   char_type fill, const std::tm* t,

   char format, char modifier ) const;

   Converts the calendar date and time stored in the std::tm object pointed to by t
   into a character string, according to the format string [fmtbeg, fmtend). The format
   string is the same as used by std::srtftime, but each format specifier is processed
   by an individual call to do_put(), which can be customized by extending this facet.

   1) Steps through the character sequence [fmtbeg, fmtend), examining the characters.
   Every character that is not a part of a format sequence is written to the output
   iterator out immediately. To identify format sequences, this function narrows the
   next character c in [fmtbeg, fmtend) as if by
   std::ctype<char_type>(str.getloc()).narrow(c,0) and if it equals '%', the next one
   or two characters are compared to the list of format sequences recognized by
   std::strftime plus any additional implementation-defined formats supported by this
   locale. For each valid format sequence, a call to do_put(out, str, fill, t, format,
   modifier) is made, where format is the format sequence character, and modifier is
   the optional format sequence modifier ('E' or 'O'). A value of '\\0' is used if the
   modifier is absent.
   2) Calls the do_put member function of the most derived class.
   3) Converts the calendar date and time stored in the std::tm object pointed to by t
   into a character string, according to the format conversion sequence formed by
   concatenating '%', the value of modifier if not '\\0', and the value of format. The
   format is interpreted the same way as the function std::strftime, except that the
   formats that are described as locale-dependent are defined by this locale, and
   additional format specifiers may be supported (the fill argument is provided for
   these implementation-defined format specifiers to use). The string is written to the
   output iterator out.

.SH Parameters

   out      - output iterator where the result of the conversion is written
   str      - a stream object that this function uses to obtain locale facets when
              needed, e.g. std::ctype to narrow characters
   t        - pointer to the std::tm object from which the date/time values are
              obtained
              pointer to the first character of a sequence of char_type characters
              specifying the conversion format

              The format string consists of zero or more conversion specifiers and
              ordinary characters (except %). All ordinary characters, including the
              terminating null character, are copied to the output string without
              modification. Each conversion specification begins with % character,
              optionally followed by E or O modifier (ignored if unsupported by the
              locale), followed by the character that determines the behavior of the
              specifier. The following format specifiers are available:

   fmtend   - pointer one past the last character of a sequence of char_type characters
              specifying the conversion format
   fill     - fill character (usually space)
   format   - the character that names a conversion specifier
   modifier - the optional modifier that may appear between % and the conversion
              specifier

.SH Return value

   Iterator pointing one past the last character that was produced .

.SH Notes

   No error handling is provided.

   The fill character is provided for those implementation-defined format specifiers
   and for the user-defined overrides of do_put() that use padding and filling logic.
   Such implementations typically make use of the formatting flags from str.
