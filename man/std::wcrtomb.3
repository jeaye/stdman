.SH NAME
std::wcrtomb \- std::wcrtomb

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cwchar>
   std::size_t wcrtomb( char* s, wchar_t wc, std::mbstate_t* ps );

   Converts a wide character to its narrow multibyte representation.

   If s is not a null pointer, the function determines the number of bytes necessary to
   store the multibyte character representation of wc (including any shift sequences,
   and taking into account the current multibyte conversion state *ps), and stores the
   multibyte character representation in the character array whose first element is
   pointed to by s, updating *ps as necessary. At most MB_CUR_MAX bytes can be written
   by this function.

   If s is a null pointer, the call is equivalent to std::wcrtomb(buf, L'\\0', ps) for
   some internal buffer buf.

   If wc is the null wide character L'\\0', a null byte is stored, preceded by any shift
   sequence necessary to restore the initial shift state and the conversion state
   parameter *ps is updated to represent the initial shift state.

.SH Parameters

   s  - pointer to narrow character array where the multibyte character will be stored
   wc - the wide character to convert
   ps - pointer to the conversion state object used when interpreting the multibyte
        string

.SH Return value

   On success, returns the number of bytes (including any shift sequences) written to
   the character array whose first element is pointed to by s.

   On failure (if wc is not a valid wide character), returns
   static_cast<std::size_t>(-1), stores EILSEQ in errno, and leaves *ps in unspecified
   state.

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <clocale>
 #include <cwchar>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <string>

 void print_wide(const std::wstring& wstr)
 {
     std::mbstate_t state{};
     for (wchar_t wc : wstr)
     {
         std::string mb(MB_CUR_MAX, '\\0');
         std::size_t ret = std::wcrtomb(&mb[0], wc, &state);
         std::cout << "multibyte char " << mb << " is " << ret << " bytes\\n";
     }
 }

 int main()
 {
     std::setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.utf8");
     std::wstring wstr = L"z\\u00df\\u6c34\\U0001f34c"; // or L"zß水🍌"
     print_wide(wstr);
 }

.SH Output:

 multibyte char z is 1 bytes
 multibyte char ß is 2 bytes
 multibyte char 水 is 3 bytes
 multibyte char 🍌 is 4 bytes
