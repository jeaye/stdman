.SH NAME
std::less_equal \- std::less_equal

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <functional>
   template< class T >             \fI(until C++14)\fP
   struct less_equal;
   template< class T = void >      \fI(since C++14)\fP
   struct less_equal;

   Function object for performing comparisons. Unless specialized, invokes operator<=
   on type T.

.SH Specializations

   A specialization of std::less_equal for any pointer type yields a strict total
   order, even if the built-in operator<= does not. The strict total order is
   consistent among specializations of std::less, std::greater, std::less_equal, and
   std::greater_equal for that pointer type, and is also consistent with the partial
   order imposed by the corresponding built-in operators (<, >, <= and >=).

   If the function call operator of the specialization
   std::less_equal<void> calls a built-in operator comparing pointers, it
   yields a strict total order even if the built-in operator<= does not.
   This strict total order is consistent among the specializations        \fI(since C++14)\fP
   std::less<void>, std::greater<void>, std::less_equal<void>, and
   std::greater_equal<void>, and is also consistent with the partial
   order imposed by the corresponding built-in operators.

   The standard library provides a specialization of std::less_equal when
   T is not specified, which leaves the parameter types and return type
   to be deduced.
                                                                          \fI(since C++14)\fP
                    function object implementing x <= y deducing argument
   less_equal<void> and return types
                    \fI(class template specialization)\fP

.SH Member functions

   operator() checks if the first argument is less than or equal to the second
              \fI(public member function)\fP

std::less_equal::operator()

   bool operator()( const T& lhs, const T& rhs ) const;            \fI(until C++14)\fP
   constexpr bool operator()( const T& lhs, const T& rhs ) const;  \fI(since C++14)\fP

   Checks if lhs is less than or equal to rhs.

.SH Parameters

   lhs, rhs - values to compare

.SH Return value

   true if lhs <= rhs, false otherwise.

.SH Exceptions

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Possible implementation

   constexpr bool operator()(const T &lhs, const T &rhs) const
   {
       return lhs <= rhs;
   }
