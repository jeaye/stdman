.SH NAME
std::launder \- std::launder

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <new>
   template <class T>          \fI(since C++17)\fP
   constexpr T* launder(T* p)

   Obtains a pointer to an object created in storage occupied by an existing object of
   the same type, even if it has const or reference members.

   Formally, given

     * the pointer p represents the address A of a byte in memory
     * an object X is located at the address A
     * X is within its lifetime
     * the type of X is the same as T, ignoring cv-qualifiers at every level
     * Every byte that would be reachable through the result is reachable through p
       (bytes are reachable through a pointer that points to an object if those bytes
       are within that object's storage, or within the immediately enclosing array of
       which the object is an element)

   Then std::launder(p) returns a value of type T* that points to the object X.

   The program is ill-formed if T is a function type or (possibly cv-qualified) void.

   std::launder may be used in a core constant expression if the value of its argument
   may be used in a core constant expression

.SH Notes

   For objects that do not have const or reference members, std::launder is not
   necessary; pointers and references can be reused

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <new>
  
 struct X {
   const int n; // note: X has a const member
   int m;
 };
 int main()
 {
   X *p = new X{3};
   const int a = p->n;
   new (p) X{5};       // p does not point to new object because X::n is const
   const int b = p->n; // undefined behavior
   const int x = p->m; // undefined behavior (even though m is non-const, p can't be used)
   const int c = std::launder(p)->n; // OK, std::launder(p) points to new object
 }
