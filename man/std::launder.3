std::launder \- std::launder

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <new>
   template <class T>                                  \fI(since C++17)\fP
   constexpr T* launder(T* p) noexcept;                \fI(until C++20)\fP
   template <class T>                                  \fI(since C++20)\fP
   [[nodiscard]] constexpr T* launder(T* p) noexcept;

   Obtains a pointer to the object located at the address represented by p.

   Formally, given

     * the pointer p represents the address A of a byte in memory
     * an object X is located at the address A
     * X is within its lifetime
     * the type of X is the same as T, ignoring cv-qualifiers at every level
     * every byte that would be reachable through the result is reachable through p
       (bytes are reachable through a pointer that points to an object Y if those bytes
       are within the storage of an object Z that is pointer-interconvertible with Y,
       or within the immediately enclosing array of which Z is an element)

   Then std::launder(p) returns a value of type T* that points to the object X.
   Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

   The program is ill-formed if T is a function type or (possibly cv-qualified) void.

   std::launder may be used in a core constant expression if the value of its argument
   may be used in a core constant expression

.SH Notes

   Typical uses of std::launder include:

     * Obtaining a pointer to an object created in the storage of an existing object of
       the same type, where pointers to the old object cannot be reused because the
       object has const or reference data members, or because either object is a base
       class subobject;
     * Obtaining a pointer to an object created by placement new from a pointer to an
       object providing storage for that object.

   The reachability restriction ensures that std::launder cannot be used to access
   bytes not accessible through the original pointer, thereby interfering with the
   compiler's escape analysis.

 int x[10];
 auto p = std::launder(reinterpret_cast<int(*)[10]>(&x[0])); // OK
  
 int x2[2][10];
 auto p2 = std::launder(reinterpret_cast<int(*)[10]>(&x2[0][0]));
 // Undefined behavior: x2[1] would be reachable through the resulting pointer to x2[0]
 // but is not reachable from the source
  
 struct X { int a[10]; } x3, x4[2]; // standard layout; assume no padding
 auto p3 = std::launder(reinterpret_cast<int(*)[10]>(&x3.a[0])); // OK
 auto p4 = std::launder(reinterpret_cast<int(*)[10]>(&x4[0].a[0]));
 // Undefined behavior: x4[1] would be reachable through the resulting pointer to x4[0].a
 // (which is pointer-interconvertible with x4[0]) but is not reachable from the source
  
 struct Y { int a[10]; double y; } x5;
 auto p5 = std::launder(reinterpret_cast<int(*)[10]>(&x5.a[0]));
 // Undefined behavior: x5.y would be reachable through the resulting pointer to x5.a
 // but is not reachable from the source

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <new>
 #include <cstddef>
 #include <cassert>
  
 struct X {
   const int n; // note: X has a const member
   int m;
 };
  
 struct Y {
   int z;
 };
  
 struct A {
     virtual int transmogrify();
 };
  
 struct B : A {
     int transmogrify() override { new(this) A; return 2; }
 };
  
 int A::transmogrify() { new(this) B; return 1; }
  
 static_assert(sizeof(B) == sizeof(A));
  
 int main()
 {
   X *p = new X{3, 4};
   const int a = p->n;
   X* np = new (p) X{5, 6};    // p does not point to new object because X::n is const; np does
   const int b = p->n; // undefined behavior
   const int c = p->m; // undefined behavior (even though m is non-const, p can't be used)
   const int d = std::launder(p)->n; // OK, std::launder(p) points to new object
   const int e = np->n; // OK
  
   alignas(Y) std::byte s[sizeof(Y)];
   Y* q = new(&s) Y{2};
   const int f = reinterpret_cast<Y*>(&s)->z; // Class member access is undefined behavior:
                                              // reinterpret_cast<Y*>(&s) has value "pointer to s"
                                              // and does not point to a Y object
   const int g = q->z; // OK
   const int h = std::launder(reinterpret_cast<Y*>(&s))->z; // OK
  
   A i;
   int n = i.transmogrify();
   // int m = i.transmogrify(); // undefined behavior
   int m = std::launder(&i)->transmogrify(); // OK
   assert(m + n == 3);
 }
