.SH Synopsis
   static void assign( char_type& r, const char_type& a );                \fI(until C++17)\fP
   static constexpr void assign( char_type& r, const char_type& a         \fI(since C++17)\fP
   );                                                             \fB(1)\fP
   static char_type* assign( char_type* p, std::size_t count,         \fB(2)\fP
   char_type a );

   Assigns a character.

   1) Assigns character a to character r.
   2) Assigns character a to each character in count characters in the character
   sequence pointed to by p.

.SH Parameters

   a     - character value to assign
   r     - character to assign to
   p     - pointer to a character sequence to assign to
   count - the length of the character sequence

.SH Return value

   1) \fI(none)\fP
   2) p

.SH Exceptions

   1)

   noexcept specification:  
   noexcept                  \fI(since C++11)\fP
     

   2) \fI(none)\fP

.SH Complexity

   1) Constant.
   2) Linear in count
