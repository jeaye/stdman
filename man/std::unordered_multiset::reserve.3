.SH Synopsis
   void reserve( size_type count );  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Sets the number of buckets to the number needed to accomodate at least count
   elements without exceeding maximum load factor and rehashes the container, i.e. puts
   the elements into appropriate buckets considering that total number of buckets has
   changed. Effectively calls rehash(std::ceil(count / max_load_factor())).
