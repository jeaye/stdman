.SH NAME
std::experimental::optional::~optional \- std::experimental::optional::~optional

.SH Synopsis
   ~optional();  (library fundamentals TS)

   If the object contains a value and the type T is not trivially destructible (see
   std::is_trivially_destructible), destroys the contained value by calling its
   destructor, as if by val->T::~T().

   Otherwise, does nothing.

.SH Notes

   If T is trivially-destructible, then this destructor is also trivial, so optional<T>
   is also trivially-destructible.
