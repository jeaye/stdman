.SH NAME
std::ranges::adjacent_view::iterator \- std::ranges::adjacent_view::iterator

.SH Synopsis
   template< bool Const >  (since C++23)
   class /*iterator*/      (exposition only*)

   The return type of adjacent_view::begin, and of adjacent_view::end when the
   underlying view V is a common_range.

   The type /*iterator*/<true> is returned by the const-qualified overloads. The type
   /*iterator*/<false> is returned by the non-const-qualified overloads.
