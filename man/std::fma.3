   1-3) Computes (x*y) + z as if to infinite precision and rounded only once to fit the
   result type.
   4) A set of overloads or a function template for all combinations of arguments of
   arithmetic type not covered by 1-3). If any argument has integral type, it is cast
   to double. If any other argument is long double, then the return type is long
   double, otherwise it is double.
   5-7) If the macro constants FP_FAST_FMAF, FP_FAST_FMA, or FP_FAST_FMAL are defined,
   the function std::fma evaluates faster (in addition to being more precise) than the
   expression x*y+z for float, double, and long double arguments, respectively. If
   defined, these macros evaluate to integer 1.

.SH Parameters

   x, y, z - values of floating-point or integral types

.SH Return value

   If successful, returns the value of (x*y) + z as if calculated to infinite precision
   and rounded once to fit the result type (or, alternatively, calculated as a single
   ternary floating-point operation)

   If a range error due to overflow occurs, ±HUGE_VAL, ±HUGE_VALF, or ±HUGE_VALL is
   returned.

   If a range error due to underflow occurs, the correct value (after rounding) is
   returned.

.SH Error handling

   Errors are reported as specified in math_errhandling

   If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559),

     * If x is zero and y is infinite or if x is infinite and y is zero, and z is not a
       NaN, then NaN is returned and FE_INVALID is raised
     * If x is zero and y is infinite or if x is infinite and y is zero, and z is a
       NaN, then NaN is returned and FE_INVALID may be raised
     * If x*y is an exact infinity and z is an infinity with the opposite sign, NaN is
       returned and FE_INVALID is raised
     * If x or y are NaN, NaN is returned
     * If z is NaN, and x*y aren't 0*Inf or Inf*0, then NaN is returned (without
       FE_INVALID)

.SH Notes

   This operation is commonly implemented in hardware as fused multiply-add CPU
   instruction. If supported by hardware, the appropriate FP_FAST_FMA* macros are
   expected to be defined, but many implementations make use of the CPU instruction
   even when the macros are not defined.

   POSIX additionally specifies that the situations specified to return FE_INVALID are
   domain errors.

   Due to its infinite intermediate precision, fma is a common building block of other
   correctly-rounded mathematical operations, such as std::sqrt or even the division
   (where not provided by the CPU, e.g. Itanium)

   As with all floating-point expressions, the expression (x*y) + z may be compiled as
   a fused multiply-add unless the #pragma STDC FP_CONTRACT is off.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <iomanip>
 #include <cmath>
 #include <cfenv>
 #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON
 int main()
 {
     // demo the difference between fma and built-in operators
     double in = 0.1;
     std::cout << "0.1 double is " << std::setprecision(23) << in
               << " (" << std::hexfloat << in << std::defaultfloat << ")\\n"
               << "0.1*10 is 1.0000000000000000555112 (0x8.0000000000002p-3), "
               << "or 1.0 if rounded to double\\n";
     double expr_result = 0.1 * 10 - 1;
     double fma_result = fma(0.1, 10, -1);
     std::cout << "0.1 * 10 - 1 = " << expr_result
               << " : 1 subtracted after intermediate rounding\\n"
               << "fma(0.1, 10, -1) = " << std::setprecision(6) << fma_result << " ("
               << std::hexfloat << fma_result << std::defaultfloat << ")\\n\\n";
  
     // fma is used in double-double arithmetic
     double high = 0.1 * 10;
     double low = fma(0.1, 10, -high);
     std::cout << "in double-double arithmetic, 0.1 * 10 is representable as "
               << high << " + " << low << "\\n\\n";
  
     // error handling
     std::feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT);
     std::cout << "fma(+Inf, 10, -Inf) = " << std::fma(INFINITY, 10, -INFINITY) << '\\n';
     if(std::fetestexcept(FE_INVALID))
         std::cout << "    FE_INVALID raised\\n";

.SH Possible output:

 0.1 double is 0.10000000000000000555112 (0x1.999999999999ap-4)
 0.1*10 is 1.0000000000000000555112 (0x8.0000000000002p-3), or 1.0 if rounded to double
 0.1 * 10 - 1 = 0 : 1 subtracted after intermediate rounding
 fma(0.1, 10, -1) = 5.55112e-17 (0x1p-54)
  
 in double-double arithmetic, 0.1 * 10 is representable as 1 + 5.55112e-17
  
 fma(+Inf, 10, -Inf) = -nan
     FE_INVALID raised
