.SH NAME
std::latch \- std::latch

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <latch>
   class latch;               \fI(since C++20)\fP

   The latch class is a downward counter of type std::ptrdiff_t which can be used to
   synchronize threads. The value of the counter is initialized on creation. Threads
   may block on the latch until the counter is decremented to zero. There is no
   possibility to increase or reset the counter, which makes the latch a single-use
   barrier.

   Concurrent invocations of the member functions of std::latch, except for the
   destructor, do not introduce data races.

   Unlike std::barrier, std::latch can be decremented by a participating thread more
   than once.

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <functional>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <latch>
 #include <string>
 #include <thread>

 int main() {
   struct job {
     const std::string name;
     std::string product{"not worked"};
     std::thread action{};
   } jobs[] = {{"annika"}, {"buru"}, {"chuck"}};

   std::latch work_done{std::size(jobs)};
   std::latch start_clean_up{1};

   auto work = [&](job& my_job) {
     my_job.product = my_job.name + " worked";
     work_done.count_down();
     start_clean_up.wait();
     my_job.product = my_job.name + " cleaned";
   };

   std::cout << "Work starting... ";
   for (auto& job : jobs) {
     job.action = std::thread{work, std::ref(job)};
   }
   work_done.wait();
   std::cout << "done:\\n";
   for (auto const& job : jobs) {
     std::cout << "  " << job.product << '\\n';
   }

   std::cout << "Workers cleaning up... ";
   start_clean_up.count_down();
   for (auto& job : jobs) {
     job.action.join();
   }
   std::cout << "done:\\n";
   for (auto const& job : jobs) {
     std::cout << "  " << job.product << '\\n';
   }
 }

.SH Output:

 Work starting... done:
   annika worked
   buru worked
   chuck worked
 Workers cleaning up... done:
   annika cleaned
   buru cleaned
   chuck cleaned
