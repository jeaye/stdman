.SH NAME
std::basic_streambuf::basic_streambuf \- std::basic_streambuf::basic_streambuf

.SH Synopsis
   protected:                                   \fB(1)\fP
   basic_streambuf();
   protected:                                   \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   basic_streambuf(const basic_streambuf& rhs);

   1) Constructs the basic_streambuf object, initializes the six pointer members
   (eback(), gptr(), egptr(), pbase(), pptr(), and epptr()) to null pointer values, and
   the locale member to std::locale(), a copy of the global C++ locale at the time of
   construction.
   2) Constructs a copy of rhs, initializing the six pointers and the locale object
   with the copies of the values held by rhs. Note that this is a shallow copy: the
   pointers of the newly-constructed basic_streambuf are pointing into the same
   character array as the pointers of rhs.

   Both constructors are protected, and are only called by the concrete streambuf
   classes, such as std::basic_filebuf, std::basic_stringbuf, or std::strstreambuf.

.SH Parameters

   rhs - a streambuf object to copy

.SH Notes

   Until C++11, it was unspecified whether basic_streambuf or any of its derived
   classes is CopyConstructible (LWG issue 421), and different C++ library
   implementations provided different options.
