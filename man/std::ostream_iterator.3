   class ostream_iterator;

   std::ostream_iterator is a single-pass OutputIterator that writes successive objects
   of type T into the std::basic_ostream object for which it was constructed, using
   operator<<. Optional delimiter string is written to the output stream after every
   write operation. The write operation is performed when the iterator (whether
   dereferenced or not) is assigned to. Incrementing the std::ostream_iterator is a
   no-op.

   In a typical implementation, the only data members of std::ostream_iterator are a
   pointer to the associated std::basic_ostream and a pointer to the first character in
   the delimiter string.

   When writing characters, std::ostreambuf_iterator is more efficient, since it avoids
   the overhead of constructing and destructing the sentry object once per character.

   These member types are required to be obtained by inheriting from             (until

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <sstream>
 #include <iterator>
 #include <numeric>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::istringstream str("0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4");
     std::partial_sum(std::istream_iterator<double>(str),
                       std::istream_iterator<double>(),
                       std::ostream_iterator<double>(std::cout, " "));
