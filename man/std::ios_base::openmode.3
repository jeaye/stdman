.SH Synopsis
   typedef /*implementation defined*/ openmode;
   static constexpr openmode app = /*implementation defined*/

   static constexpr openmode binary = /*implementation defined*/
   static constexpr openmode in = /*implementation defined*/
   static constexpr openmode out = /*implementation defined*/
   static constexpr openmode trunc = /*implementation defined*/

   static constexpr openmode ate = /*implementation defined*/

   Specifies available file open flags. It is a BitmaskType, the following constants
   are defined:

   Constant Explanation
   app      seek to the end of stream before each write
   binary   open in binary mode
   in       open for reading
   out      open for writing
   trunc    discard the contents of the stream when opening
   ate      seek to the end of stream immediately after open
