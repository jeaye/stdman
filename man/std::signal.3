.TH std::signal 3 "Jun 28 2014" "2.0 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <csignal>
   void (*signal( int sig, void (*handler) (int))) (int);

   Sets the error handler for signal sig. The signal handler can be set so that default
   handling will occur, signal is ignored, or an user-defined function is called.

   When signal handler is set to a function and a signal occurs, it is implementation
   defined whether std::signal(sig, SIG_DFL) will be executed immediately before the
   start of signal handler. Also, the implementation can prevent some
   implementation-defined set of signals from occurring while the signal handler runs.

   For some of the signals, the implementation may call std::signal(sig, SIG_IGN) at
   the startup of the program. For the rest, the implementation must call
   std::signal(sig, SIG_DFL).

.SH Parameters

             the signal to set the signal handler to. It can be an
             implementation-defined value or one of the following values:

             SIGABRT
   sig     - SIGFPE
             SIGILL  defines signal types
             SIGINT  (macro constant) 
             SIGSEGV
             SIGTERM
             the signal handler. This must be one of the following:

               * SIG_DFL macro. The signal handler is set to default signal handler.
   handler -   * SIG_IGN macro. The signal is ignored.
               * pointer to a function. The signature of the function must be
                 equivalent to the following:

             void fun(int sig);

.SH Return value

   Previous signal handler on success or SIG_ERR on failure (setting a signal handler
   can be disabled on some implementations).

   Signal handler

   The following limitations are imposed on the user-defined function that is installed
   as a signal handler.

   If the user defined function returns when handling SIGFPE, SIGILL, SIGSEGV or any
   other implementation-defined signal specifying a computational exception, the
   behavior is undefined.

   If the signal handler is called as a result of std::abort or std::raise, the
   behavior is undefined if the signal handler calls std::raise.

   If the signal handler is called NOT as a result of std::abort or std::raise, the
   behavior is undefined if

     * the signal handler calls any function within the standard library, except
       std::abort, std::_Exit, std::quick_exit, or std::signal with the first argument
       not being the number of the signal currently handled.
     * the signal handler refers to any object with static or thread-local\fI(since C++11)\fP
       storage duration that is not std::atomic\fI(since C++11)\fP or volatile
       std::sig_atomic_t.

   On entry to the signal handler, the state of the floating-point environment and the
   values of all objects is unspecified, except for

     * objects of type volatile std::sig_atomic_t
     * objects of std::atomic types \fI(since C++11)\fP
     * side effects made visible through std::atomic_signal_fence \fI(since C++11)\fP

   On return from a signal handler, the value of any object modified by the signal
   handler that is not volatile std::sig_atomic_t or std::atomic is undefined.

   The behavior is undefined if std::signal is used in a multithreaded program. It is
   not required to be thread-safe.

.SH Notes

   POSIX requires that signal is thread-safe, and specifies a list of async-signal-safe
   library functions that may be called from any signal handler.

   Signal handlers are expected to have C linkage and, in general, only use the
   features from the common subset of C and C++. It is implementation-defined if a
   function with C++ linkage can be used as a signal handler.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <csignal>
 #include <iostream>
  
 namespace
 {
   volatile sig_atomic_t gSignalStatus = 0;
 }
  
 void signal_handler(int signal)
 {
   gSignalStatus = signal;
 }
  
 int main()
 {
   // Install a signal handler
   std::signal(SIGINT, signal_handler);
  
   std::cout << "SignalValue: " << gSignalStatus << '\\n';
   std::cout << "Sending signal " << SIGINT << '\\n';
   std::raise(SIGINT);
   std::cout << "SignalValue: " << gSignalStatus << '\\n';
 }

.SH Possible output:

 SignalValue: 0
 Sending signal 2
 SignalValue: 2
