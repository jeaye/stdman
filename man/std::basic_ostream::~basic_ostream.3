.SH NAME
std::basic_ostream::~basic_ostream \- std::basic_ostream::~basic_ostream

.SH Synopsis
   virtual ~basic_ostream();

   Destroys the basic_ostream object. This destructor does not perform any operation on
   the underlying streambuffer (rdbuf()): the destructors of the derived output streams
   such as std::basic_ofstream and std::basic_ostringstream are responsible for calling
   the destructors of the stream buffers.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <sstream>
 #include <iostream>
 void add_words(std::streambuf* p)
 {
     std::ostream buf(p); // buf shares the buffer with s
     buf << " is the answer";
 } // calls the destructor of buf. p remains unaffected
 int main()
 {
     std::ostringstream s;
     s << 42;
     add_words(s.rdbuf());
     s << ".";
     std::cout << s.str() << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 42 is the answer.
