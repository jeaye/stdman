   Constructs new underlying container of the container adaptor from a variety of data
   sources.

   1) Default constructor. Value-initializes the container.
   2) Copy-constructs the underlying container c with the contents of cont.
   This is also the default constructor.
   \fI(until C++11)\fP
   3) Move-constructs the underlying container c with std::move(cont).
   4) Copy constructor. The adaptor is copy-constructed with the contents of other.c.
   (implicitly declared)
   5) Move constructor. The adaptor is constructed with std::move(other.c). (implicitly
   declared)
   6-10) The following constructors are only defined if
   std::uses_allocator<container_type, Alloc>::value == true, that is, if the
   underlying container is an allocator-aware container (true for all standard library
   containers that can be used with stack).
   6) Constructs the underlying container using alloc as allocator, as if by c(alloc).
   7) Constructs the underlying container with the contents of cont and using alloc as
   allocator, as if by c(cont, alloc).
   8) Constructs the underlying container with the contents of cont using move
   semantics while utilizing alloc as allocator, as if by c(std::move(cont), alloc).
   9) Constructs the adaptor with the contents of other.c and using alloc as allocator,
   as if by c(other.c, alloc).
   10) Constructs the adaptor with the contents of other using move semantics while
   utilizing alloc as allocator, as if by c(std::move(other.c), alloc).

.SH Parameters

   alloc                -          allocator to use for all memory allocations of the
                                   underlying container
   other                -          another container adaptor to be used as source to
                                   initialize the underlying container
   cont                 -          container to be used as source to initialize the
                                   underlying container
   first, last          -          range of elements to initialize with
.SH Type requirements
   -
   Alloc must meet the requirements of Allocator.
   -
   Container must meet the requirements of Container. The constructors (5-10) are only
   defined if Container meets the requirements of AllocatorAwareContainer
   -
   InputIt must meet the requirements of LegacyInputIterator.

.SH Complexity

   Same as the corresponding operation on the wrapped container.

   Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to
   previously published C++ standards.

     DR    Applied to      Behavior as published       Correct behavior

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <stack>
 #include <deque>
 #include <iostream>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::stack<int> c1;
     c1.push(5);
     std::cout << c1.size() << '\\n';
  
     std::stack<int> c2(c1);
     std::cout << c2.size() << '\\n';
  
     std::deque<int> deq {3, 1, 4, 1, 5};
     std::stack<int> c3(deq);
     std::cout << c3.size() << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 1
 1
 5
