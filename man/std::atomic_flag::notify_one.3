.SH NAME
std::atomic_flag::notify_one \- std::atomic_flag::notify_one

.SH Synopsis
   void notify_one() noexcept;           \fI(since C++20)\fP
   void notify_one() volatile noexcept;

   Performs atomic notifying operations.

   If there is a thread blocked in atomic waiting operation (i.e. wait()) on *this,
   then unblocks at least one such thread; otherwise does nothing.

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Notes

   This form of change-detection is often more efficient than simple polling or pure
   spinlocks.
