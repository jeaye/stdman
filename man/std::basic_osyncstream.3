std::basic_osyncstream \- std::basic_osyncstream

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <syncstream>
   template<

       class CharT,
       class Traits = std::char_traits<CharT>,                           \fI(since C++20)\fP
       class Allocator = std::allocator<CharT>

   > class basic_osyncstream : public std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>

   The class template std::basic_osyncstream is a convenience wrapper for
   std::basic_syncbuf. It provides a mechanism to synchronize threads writing to the
   same stream.

   It can be used with a named variable:

 {
     std::osyncstream synced_out(std::cout); // synchronized wrapper for std::cout
     synced_out << "Hello, ";
     synced_out << "World!";
     synced_out << std::endl; // flush is noted, but not yet performed
     synced_out << "and more!\\n";
 } // characters are transferred and std::cout is flushed

   as well as with a temporary:

 std::osyncstream(std::cout) << "Hello, " << "World!" << '\\n';

   It provides the guarantee that all output made to the same final destination buffer
   (std::cout in the examples above) will be free of data races and will not be
   interleaved or garbled in any way, as long as every write to that final destination
   buffer is made through (possibly different) instances of std::basic_osyncstream.

   Typical implementation of std::basic_osyncstream holds only one member: the wrapped
   std::basic_syncbuf.
