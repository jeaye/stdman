.SH NAME
std::experimental::ranges::not_equal_to \- std::experimental::ranges::not_equal_to

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/ranges/functional>
   template< class T = void >

   requires EqualityComparable<T> ||
   Same<T, void> ||                                                         (ranges TS)
   /* == on two const T lvalues invokes a built-in operator comparing
   pointers */

   struct not_equal_to;
   template <>                                                              (ranges TS)
   struct not_equal_to<void>;

   Function object for performing comparisons. The primary template invokes operator ==
   on const lvalues of type T and negates the result. The specialization
   not_equal_to<void> deduces the parameter types of the function call operator from
   the arguments (but not the return type).

   All specializations of not_equal_to are Semiregular.

   requires EqualityComparableWith<T, U> ||
   /* std::declval<T>() == std::declval<U>()         (member only of not_equal_to<void>
   resolves to                                   \fB(2)\fP specialization)
   a built-in operator comparing pointers */

   constexpr bool operator()(T&& t, U&& u)
   const;

   1) Compares x and y. Equivalent to return !ranges::equal_to<>{}(x, y);
   2) Compares t and u. Equivalent to return !ranges::equal_to<>{}(std::forward<T>(t),
   std::forward<U>(u));.

.SH Notes

   Unlike std::not_equal_to, ranges::not_equal_to requires both == and != to be valid
   (via the EqualityComparable and EqualityComparableWith constraints), and is entirely
   defined in terms of ranges::equal_to. However, the implementation is free to use
   operator!= directly, because those concepts require the results of == and != to be
   consistent.
