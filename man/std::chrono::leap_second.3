.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <chrono>
   class leap_second;          \fI(since C++20)\fP

   The class leap_second represents the date and time of a leap second insertion.

   Users cannot construct leap_second objects except by copying from existing
   leap_second objects. The library implementation creates leap_second objects when it
   initializes the time zone database and provides const access to these objects.

   leap_second has a defaulted copy constructor and a defaulted copy assignment
   operator.
