.TH std::fclose 3 "2019.08.27" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::fclose \- std::fclose

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstdio>
   int fclose( std::FILE* stream );

   Closes the given file stream. Any unwritten buffered data are flushed to the OS. Any
   unread buffered data are discarded.

   Whether or not the operation succeeds, the stream is no longer associated with a
   file, and the buffer allocated by std::setbuf or std::setvbuf, if any, is also
   disassociated and deallocated if automatic allocation was used.

   The behavior is undefined if the value of the pointer stream is used after fclose
   returns.

.SH Parameters

   stream - the file stream to close

.SH Return value

   0 on success, EOF otherwise

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <cstdio>
 #include <cstdlib>

 int main()
 {
     FILE* fp = std::fopen("test.txt", "r");
     if(!fp) {
         std::perror("File opening failed");
         return EXIT_FAILURE;
     }

     int c; // note: int, not char, required to handle EOF
     while ((c = std::fgetc(fp)) != EOF) { // standard C I/O file reading loop
        std::putchar(c);
     }

     if (std::ferror(fp))
         std::puts("I/O error when reading");
     else if (std::feof(fp))
         std::puts("End of file reached successfully");

     std::fclose(fp);
 }
