.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <map>
   template<

       class Key,
       class T,
       class Compare = std::less<Key>,
       class Allocator = std::allocator<std::pair<const Key, T> >

   > class multimap;

   Multimap is an associative container that contains a sorted list of key-value pairs.
   Sorting is done according to the comparison function Compare, applied to the keys.
   Search, insertion, and removal operations have logarithmic complexity.

   The order of the key-value pairs whose keys compare equivalent is the order of
   insertion and does not change. \fI(since C++11)\fP

   std::multimap meets the requirements of Container, AllocatorAwareContainer,
   AssociativeContainer and ReversibleContainer.
