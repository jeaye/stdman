.SH NAME
std::coroutine_handle::from_promise \- std::coroutine_handle::from_promise

.SH Synopsis
   static coroutine_handle from_promise( Promise& p );  \fI(since C++20)\fP

   Creates a coroutine_handle from the promise object of a coroutine. The created
   coroutine_handle refers the coroutine, and promise() returns a reference to p.

   The behavior is undefined if p is not a reference to a promise object. This function
   is only provided for the primary template, i.e. specializations
   std::coroutine_handle<> and std::coroutine_handle<std::noop_coroutine_promise> do
   not have this function.

.SH Parameters

   p - promise object of a coroutine to refer

.SH Return value

   A coroutine_handle referring the given coroutine.
