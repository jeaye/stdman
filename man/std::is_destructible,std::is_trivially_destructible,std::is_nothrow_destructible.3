.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <type_traits>
   template< class T >               \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   struct is_destructible;
   template< class T >               \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   struct is_trivially_destructible;
   template< class T >               \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   struct is_nothrow_destructible;

   1) If an imaginary struct containing a member object of type T has a
   non-deleted destructor, provides the member constant value equal true. \fI(until C++14)\fP
   For any other type, value is false.
   1) If T is a reference type, provides the member constant value equal
   true

   If T is an incomplete type (including void) or a function type, value
   equals false.                                                          \fI(since C++14)\fP

   If T is an object type, then, for the type U equal
   std::remove_all_extents<T>::type, if the expression
   std::declval<U&>().~U() is well-formed in unevaluated context, value
   equals true. Otherwise, value equals false.

   2) same as 1), but the destructor does not call any operation that is not trivial.

   3) same as 1), but the destructor is noexcept.

.SH Member constants

   value    true if T is destructible, false otherwise
   \fB[static]\fP \fI(public static member constant)\fP

.SH Member functions

   operator bool converts the object to bool, returns value
                 \fI(public member function)\fP

.SH Member types

   Type       Definition
   value_type bool
   type       std::integral_constant<bool, value>

.SH Notes

   Because the C++ program terminates if a destructor throws an exception during stack
   unwinding (which usually cannot be predicted), all practical destructors are
   non-throwing even if they are not declared noexcept. All destructors found in the
   C++ standard library are non-throwing.

   Storage occupied by trivially destructible objects may be reused without calling the
   destructor.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <string>
 #include <type_traits>
 struct Foo {
    std::string str;
    ~Foo() noexcept {};
 };
 struct Bar {
     ~Bar() = default;
 };
 int main() {
     std::cout << std::boolalpha
               << "std::string is destructible? "
               << std::is_destructible<std::string>::value << '\\n'
               << "Foo is nothrow destructible? "
               << std::is_nothrow_destructible<Foo>::value << '\\n'
               << "Bar is trivally destructible? "
               << std::is_trivially_destructible<Bar>::value << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 std::string is destructible? true
 Foo is nothrow destructible? true
 Bar is trivally destructible? true
