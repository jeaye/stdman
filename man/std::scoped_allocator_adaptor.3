std::scoped_allocator_adaptor \- std::scoped_allocator_adaptor

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <scoped_allocator>
   template< class OuterAlloc, class... InnerAlloc >    \fI(since C++11)\fP
   class scoped_allocator_adaptor : public OuterAlloc;

   The std::scoped_allocator_adaptor class template is an allocator which can be used
   with multilevel containers (vector of sets of lists of tuples of maps, etc). It is
   instantiated with one outer allocator type OuterAlloc and zero or more inner
   allocator types InnerAlloc.... A container constructed directly with a
   scoped_allocator_adaptor uses OuterAlloc to allocate its elements, but if an element
   is itself a container, it uses the first inner allocator. The elements of that
   container, if they are themselves containers, use the second inner allocator, etc.
   If there are more levels to the container than there are inner allocators, the last
   inner allocator is reused for all further nested containers.

   For the purpose of scoped_allocator_adaptor, if the next inner allocator is A, any
   class T for which std::uses_allocator<T,A>::value == true participates in the
   recursion as if it was a container. Additionally, std::pair is treated as such a
   container by specific overloads of scoped_allocator_adaptor::construct.

   Typical implementation holds an instance of a
   std::scoped_allocator_adaptor<InnerAllocs...> as a member object.
