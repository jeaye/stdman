   Constructs a new shared_future.

   1) Default constructor. Constructs an empty shared future, that doesn't refer to a
   shared state, that is valid() == false.
   2) Constructs a shared future that refers to the same shared state, if any, as
   other.
   3,4) Transfers the shared state held by other to *this. After the construction,
   other.valid() == false, and this->valid() returns the same value as other.valid()
   would have returned before the construction.

.SH Parameters

   other - another future object to initialize with
