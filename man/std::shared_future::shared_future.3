.SH Synopsis
   shared_future();                             \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   shared_future( const shared_future& other ); \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   shared_future( std::future<T>&& other );     \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   shared_future( shared_future&& other );      \fB(4)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Constructs a new shared_future.

   1) Default constructor. Constructs an empty shared future, that doesn't refer to a
   shared state, that is valid() == false.
   2) Constructs a shared future that refers to the same shared state, if any, as
   other.
   3-4) Transfers the shared state held by other to *this. After the construction,
   other.valid() == false, and this->valid() returns the same value as other.valid()
   would have returned before the construction.

.SH Parameters

   other - another future object to initialize with
