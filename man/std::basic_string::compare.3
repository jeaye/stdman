   Compares two character sequences.

   1) Compares this string to str. First, calculates the number of characters to
   compare, as if by size_type rlen = std::min(size(), str.size()). Then compares by
   calling Traits::compare(data(), str.data(), rlen). For standard strings this
   function performs character-by-character lexicographical comparison. If the result
   is zero (the strings are equal so far), then their sizes are compared as follows:

                         Condition                             Result      Return value
   Traits::compare(data, arg, rlen) < 0                   data is less     <0
                                                          than arg
                                      size(data) <        data is less     <0
                                      size(arg)           than arg
   Traits::compare(data, arg, rlen)   size(data) ==       data is equal to 0
   == 0                               size(arg)           arg
                                      size(data) >        data is greater  >0
                                      size(arg)           than arg
   Traits::compare(data, arg, rlen) > 0                   data is greater  >0
                                                          than arg

   2) Compares a [pos1, pos1+count1) substring of this string to str as if by
   basic_string(*this, pos1, count1).compare(str)
   \fI(until C++17)\fP
   compare(pos1, count1, std::basic_string_view<CharT, Traits>(str))
   \fI(since C++17)\fP
   3) Compares a [pos1, pos1+count1) substring of this string to a substring [pos2,
   pos2+count2) of str as if by
   basic_string(*this, pos1, count1).compare(basic_string(str, pos2, count2))
   \fI(until C++17)\fP
   compare(pos1, count1, std::basic_string_view<CharT, Traits>(str), pos2, count2)
   \fI(since C++17)\fP
   4) Compares this string to the null-terminated character sequence beginning at the
   character pointed to by s, as if by compare(basic_string(s))
   5) Compares a [pos1, pos1+count1) substring of this string to the null-terminated
   character sequence beginning at the character pointed to by s, as if by
   basic_string(*this, pos, count1).compare(basic_string(s))
   6) Compares a [pos1, pos1+count1) substring of this string to the first count2
   characters of the character array whose first character is pointed to by s, as if by
   basic_string(*this, pos, count1).compare(basic_string(s, count2)). (Note: the
   characters from s to s+count2 may include null characters))
   7) Compares this string to sv, similar to \fB(1)\fP except for using sv.size() and
   sv.data() instead of str.size() and str.data()
   8) Compares a [pos1, pos1+count1) substring of this string to sv, as if by
   std::basic_string_view<CharT, Traits>(this.data(), pos1, count1).compare(sv)
   9) Compares a [pos1, pos1+count1) substring of this string to a substring [pos2,
   pos2+count2) of sv, as if by std::basic_string_view<CharT, Traits>(this.data(),
   pos1, count1).compare(sv, pos2, count2)

.SH Parameters

   str    - other string to compare to
   s      - pointer to the character string to compare to
   count1 - number of characters of this string to compare
   pos1   - position of the first character in this string to compare
   count2 - number of characters of the given string to compare
   pos2   - position of the first character of the given string to compare
   sv     - std::basic_string_view to compare to

.SH Return value

   negative value if *this appears before the character sequence specified by the
   arguments, in lexicographical order

   zero if both character sequences compare equivalent

   positive value if *this appears after the character sequence specified by the
   arguments, in lexicographical order

.SH Exceptions

   1)

   \fI(none)\fP                  \fI(until C++11)\fP
   noexcept specification: \fI(since C++11)\fP
   noexcept

   2-6) May throw the exceptions thrown by the corresponding basic_string constructors.

   7)

   noexcept

.SH Possible implementation

template<class CharT, class Traits, class Alloc>
int basic_string<CharT, Traits, Alloc>::compare(const std::basic_string& s) const noexcept
{
    size_type lhs_sz = size();
    size_type rhs_sz = s.size();
    int result = traits_type::compare(data(), s.data(), std::min(lhs_sz, rhs_sz));
    if (result != 0)
        return result;
    if (lhs_sz < rhs_sz)
        return -1;
    if (lhs_sz > rhs_sz)
        return 1;
    return 0;
}

.SH Notes

   For the situations when three-way comparison is not required, std::basic_string
   provides the usual relational operators (<, <=, ==, >, etc).

   By default (with the default std::char_traits), this function is not
   locale-sensitive. See std::collate::compare for locale-aware three-way string
   comparison.
