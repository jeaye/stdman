.TH std::basic_streambuf::~basic_streambuf 3 "Sep  4 2015" "2.0 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   virtual ~basic_streambuf();

   This destruction is empty: the members of this basic_streambuf (the pointers and the
   locale) are destructed in accordance with the usual object destruction sequence
   after this destructor returns. However, since it is declared public virtual, it
   allows the objects that are derived from std::basic_streambuf to be deleted through
   a pointer to base class.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <fstream>

 int main()
 {
     std::filebuf* fbp = new std::filebuf;
     fbp->open("test.txt", std::ios_base::out);
     fbp->sputn("Hello\\n", 6);
     std::streambuf* sbp = fbp;
     delete sbp; // the file is closed, output flushed and written
     std::ifstream f("test.txt");
     std::cout << f.rdbuf(); // proof
 }

.SH Output:

 Hello
