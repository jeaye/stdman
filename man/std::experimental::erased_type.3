.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/utility>
   struct erased_type { };                   (library fundamentals TS)

   The struct erased_type is an empty struct that serves as a placeholder for a type in
   situations where the actual type is determined at runtime. For example, in classes
   that use type-erased allocators, the nested typedef allocator_type is an alias for
   erased_type.
