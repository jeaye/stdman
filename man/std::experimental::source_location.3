std::experimental::source_location \- std::experimental::source_location

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/source_location>
   struct source_location;                           (library fundamentals TS v2)

   The source_location class represents certain information about the source code, such
   as file names, line numbers, and function names. Previously, functions that desire
   to obtain this information about the call site (for logging, testing, or debugging
   purposes) must use macros so that predefined macros like __LINE__ and __FILE__ are
   expanded in the context of the caller. The source_location class provides a better
   alternative.

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <string_view>
 #include <experimental/source_location>

 void log(const std::string_view& message, const std::experimental::source_location& location = std::experimental::source_location::current())
 {
     std::cout << "info:"
               << location.file_name() << ":"
               << location.line() << " "
               << message << '\\n';
 }

 int main()
 {
     log("Hello world!");
 }

.SH Possible output:

 info:main.cpp:15 Hello world!
