.SH NAME
std::numeric_limits::round_style \- std::numeric_limits::round_style

.SH Synopsis
   static const std::float_round_style round_style      \fI(until C++11)\fP
   static constexpr std::float_round_style round_style  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   The value of std::numeric_limits<T>::round_stylem identifies the rounding style used
   by the floating-point type T whenever a value that is not one of the exactly
   repesentable values of T is stored in an object of that type.

.SH Example

   The decimal value 0.1 cannot be represented by a binary floating-point type. When
   stored in an IEEE-745 double, it falls between 0x1.9999999999999*2-4
   and 0x1.999999999999a*2-4
   . Rounding to nearest representable value results in 0x1.999999999999a*2-4
   .

   Similarly, the decimal value 0.3, which is between 0x1.3333333333333*2-2
   and 0x1.3333333333334*2-2
   is rounded to nearest and is stored as 0x1.3333333333333*2-2
   .

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <limits>
 int main()
 {
     std::cout << std::hexfloat << "The decimal 0.1 is stored in a double as "
               << 0.1 << '\\n'
               << "The decimal 0.3 is stored in a double as "
               << 0.3 << '\\n'
               << "The rounding style is " << std::numeric_limits<double>::round_style << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 The decimal 0.1 is stored in a double as 0x1.999999999999ap-4
 The decimal 0.3 is stored in a double as 0x1.3333333333333p-2
 The rounding style is 1
