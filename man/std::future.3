.SH NAME
std::future \- std::future

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <future>
   template< class T > class future;       \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   template< class T > class future<T&>;   \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   template<>          class future<void>; \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   The class template std::future provides a mechanism to access the result of
   asynchronous operations:

     * An asynchronous operation (created via std::async, std::packaged_task, or
       std::promise) can provide a std::future object to the creator of that
       asynchronous operation.

     * The creator of the asynchronous operation can then use a variety of methods to
       query, wait for, or extract a value from the std::future. These methods may
       block if the asynchronous operation has not yet provided a value.

     * When the asynchronous operation is ready to send a result to the creator, it can
       do so by modifying shared state (e.g. std::promise::set_value) that is linked to
       the creator's std::future.

   Note that std::future references shared state that is not shared with any other
   asynchronous return objects (as opposed to std::shared_future).

.SH Member functions

   constructor   constructs the future object
                 \fI(public member function)\fP 
   destructor    destructs the future object
                 \fI(public member function)\fP 
   operator=     moves the future object
                 \fI(public member function)\fP 
                 transfers the shared state from *this to a shared_future and returns
   share         it
                 \fI(public member function)\fP 
.SH Getting the result
   get           returns the result
                 \fI(public member function)\fP 
.SH State
   valid         checks if the future has a shared state
                 \fI(public member function)\fP 
   wait          waits for the result to become available
                 \fI(public member function)\fP 
                 waits for the result, returns if it is not available for the specified
   wait_for      timeout duration
                 \fI(public member function)\fP 
                 waits for the result, returns if it is not available until specified
   wait_until    time point has been reached
                 \fI(public member function)\fP 

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <future>
 #include <thread>
  
 int main()
 {
     // future from a packaged_task
     std::packaged_task<int()> task([]{ return 7; }); // wrap the function
     std::future<int> f1 = task.get_future();  // get a future
     std::thread t(std::move(task)); // launch on a thread
  
     // future from an async()
     std::future<int> f2 = std::async(std::launch::async, []{ return 8; });
  
     // future from a promise
     std::promise<int> p;
     std::future<int> f3 = p.get_future();
     std::thread( [&p]{ p.set_value_at_thread_exit(9); }).detach();
  
     std::cout << "Waiting..." << std::flush;
     f1.wait();
     f2.wait();
     f3.wait();
     std::cout << "Done!\\nResults are: "
               << f1.get() << ' ' << f2.get() << ' ' << f3.get() << '\\n';
     t.join();
 }

.SH Output:

 Waiting...Done!
 Results are: 7 8 9

   async         runs a function asynchronously (potentially in a new thread) and
   \fI(C++11)\fP       returns a std::future that will hold the result
                 \fI(function template)\fP 
   shared_future waits for a value (possibly referenced by other futures) that is set
   \fI(C++11)\fP       asynchronously
