.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <random>
   template<

   class Engine,                  \fI(since C++11)\fP
   std::size_t P, std::size_t R

   > class discard_block_engine;

   discard_block_engine is a pseudo-random number engine adaptor that discards a
   certain amount of data produced by the base engine. From each block of size P
   generated by the base engine, the adaptor keeps only R numbers, discarding the rest.

.SH Template parameters

   Engine - the type of the wrapped engine.
   P      - the size of a block. Expected that \\(\\small{P>0}\\)P > 0.
   R      - the number of used numbers per block. Expected that \\(\\small{0<R\\le P}\\)0 <
            R ≤ P.
.SH Type requirements
   -
   Engine must meet the requirements of RandomNumberEngine.

.SH Member functions

   constructor      constructs the engine adaptor
   \fI(C++11)\fP          \fI(public member function)\fP
   seed             sets the state of the underlying engine
   \fI(C++11)\fP          \fI(public member function)\fP
   base             returns the underlying engine
   \fI(C++11)\fP          \fI(public member function)\fP
.SH Generation
   operator()       advances the state of the underlying engine and returns the
   \fI(C++11)\fP          generated value
                    \fI(public member function)\fP
   discard          advances the adaptor's state by a specified amount
   \fI(C++11)\fP          \fI(public member function)\fP
.SH Characteristics
   min              gets the smallest possible value in the output range of the
   \fB[static]\fP \fI(C++11)\fP underlying engine.
                    \fI(public static member function)\fP
   max              gets the largest possible value in the output range of the
   \fB[static]\fP \fI(C++11)\fP underlying engine.
                    \fI(public static member function)\fP

.SH Non-member functions

   operator==                compares the internal states of the adaptors and
   operator!=                underlying engines

   \fI(C++11)\fP(removed in C++20)
   operator<<                performs stream input and output on pseudo-random number
