.SH Synopsis
   static const int radix;      \fI(until C++11)\fP
   static constexpr int radix;  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   The value of std::numeric_limits<T>::radix is the base of the number system used in
   the representation of the type. It is 2 for all binary numeric types, but it may be,
   for example, 10 for IEEE 754 decimal floating-point types or for third-party
   binary-coded decimal integers. This constant is meaningful for all specializations.
