   1) Public member function, calls the member function do_get of the most derived
   class.
   2) Reads characters from the input iterator in and generates the value of the type
   of v, taking into account IO stream formatting flags from str.flags(), character
   classification rules from std::use_facet<std::ctype<charT>>(str.getloc()), and
   numeric punctuation characters from
   std::use_facet<std::numpunct<charT>>(str.getloc()). This function is called by all
   formatted input stream operators such as std::cin >> n;.

   Conversion occurs in three stages

.SH Stage 1: conversion specifier selection

     * I/O format flags are obtained, as if by

   fmtflags basefield = (str.flags() & std::ios_base::basefield);
   fmtflags boolalpha = (str.flags() & std::ios_base::boolalpha);

     * If the type of v is an integer type, the the first applicable choice of the
       following five is selected:

   If basefield == oct, will use conversion specifier %o
   If basefield == hex, will use conversion specifier %X
   If basefield == 0, will use conversion specifier %i
   If the type of v is signed, will use conversion specifier %d
   If the type of v is unsigned, will use conversion specifier %u

     * For integer types, length modifier is added to the conversion specification if
       necessary: h for short and unsigned short, l for long and unsigned long, ll for
       long long and unsigned long long
     * If the type of v is float, will use conversion specifier %g
     * If the type of v is double, will use conversion specifier %lg
     * If the type of v is long double, will use conversion specifier %Lg
     * If the type of v is void*, will use conversion specifier %p
     * If the type of v is bool and boolalpha==0, proceeds as if the type of v is long,
       except for the value to be stored in v in stage 3.
     * If the type of v is bool and boolalpha!=0, the following replaces stages 2 and
       3:

          * Successive characters obtained from the input iterator in are matched
            against the character sequences obtained from
            std::use_facet<std::numpunct<charT>>(str.getloc()).falsename() and
            std::use_facet<std::numpunct<charT> >(str.getloc()).truename() only as
            necessary as to identify the unique match. The input iterator in is
            compared to end only when necessary to obtain a character.
          * If the target sequence is uniquely matched, v is set to the corresponding
            bool value. Otherwise false is stored in v and std::ios_base::failbit is
            assigned to err. If unique match could not be found before the input ended
            (in==end), err|=std::ios_base::eofbit is executed.

.SH Stage 2: character extraction

     * If in==end, Stage 2 is terminated immediately, no further characters are
       extracted
     * The next character is extracted from in as if by char_type ct = *in;

          * If the character matches one of "0123456789abcdefxABCDEFX+-", widened to
            the locale's char_type as if by
            std::use_facet<std::ctype<charT>>(str.getloc()).widen(), it is converted to
            the corresponding char.
          * If the character matches the decimal point separator
            (std::use_facet<std::numpunct<charT>>(str.getloc()).decimal_point())), it
            is replaced by '.'.
          * If the character matches the thousands separator
            (std::use_facet<std::numpunct<charT>>(str.getloc()).thousands_sep()) and
            the thousands separation is in use at all
            std::use_facet<std::numpunct<charT>>(str.getloc()).grouping().length() !=
            0, then if the decimal point '.' has not yet been accumulated, the position
            of the character is remembered, but the character is otherwise ignored. If
            the decimal point has already been accumulated, the character is discarded
            and Stage 2 terminates.
          * In any case, the check is made whether the char obtained from the previous
            steps is allowed in the input field that would be parsed by std::scanf
            given the conversion specifier selected in Stage 1. If it is allowed, it is
            accumulated in a temporary buffer and Stage 2 repeats. If it is not
            allowed, Stage 2 terminates.

.SH Stage 3: conversion and storage

     * The sequence of chars accumulated in Stage 2 is converted to a numeric value

   The input is parsed as if by std::scanf with the conversion specifier  \fI(until C++11)\fP
   selected in Stage 1
   The input is parsed as if by std::strtoll for signed integer v,        \fI(since C++11)\fP
   std::strtoull for unsigned integer v, or std::strtold for              \fI(until C++17)\fP
   floating-point v
   The input is parsed as if by std::strtoll for signed integer v,
   std::strtoull for unsigned integer v, std::strtof for float v,         \fI(since C++17)\fP
   std::strtod for double v, or std::strtold for long double v

     * If the conversion function fails to convert the entire field, the
       value is stored in v
     * If the conversion function results in a positive value too large
       to fit in the type of v, the most positive representable value is
       stored in v                                                        \fI(since C++11)\fP
     * If the conversion function results in a negative value too large
       to fit in the type of v, the most negative representable value is
       stored in v
       , or zero for unsigned integer types.
       \fI(until C++17)\fP

     * In any case, if the conversion function fails std::ios_base::failbit is assigned
       to err
     * Otherwise, the numeric result of the conversion is stored in v

          * If the type of v is bool and boolalpha is not set, then if the value to be
            stored is, false is stored, if the value to be stored is 1, true is
            stored, for any other value std::ios_base::failbit is assigned to err and
            true is stored.

     * After this, digit grouping is checked. if the position of any of the thousands
       separators discarded in Stage 2 does not match the grouping provided by
       std::use_facet<std::numpunct<charT>>(str.getloc()).grouping(),
       std::ios_base::failbit is assigned to err.
     * If Stage 2 was terminated by the test in==end, err|=std::ios_base::eofbit is
       executed to set the eof bit.

.SH Notes

   In C++98/C++03, if an error occurs, v is left unchanged. In C++11, it is set to a
   value as described above.

   The result of converting a negative number string into an unsigned integer was
   specified to produce zero until C++17, although some implementations followed the
   protocol of std::strtoull which negates in the target type, giving ULLONG_MAX for
   "-1", and so produce the largest value of the target type instead. As of C++17,
   strictly following std::strtoull is the correct behavior.

   Because stage 2 filters out characters such as 'p', 'N' or 'i', the hexadecimal
   floating-point numbers such as "0x1.23p-10" and the strings "NaN" or "inf" may be
   rejected by do_get(double) even if they are valid input to strtod: this is LWG #2381
