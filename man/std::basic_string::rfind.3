   noexcept(/* see below */);

   Finds the last substring equal to the given character sequence. Search begins at
   pos, i.e. the found substring must not begin in a position following pos. If npos or
   any value not smaller than size()-1 is passed as pos, whole string will be searched.

   1) Finds the last substring equal to str.
   2) Finds the last substring equal to the range [s, s+count). This range can include
   null characters.
   3) Finds the last substring equal to the character string pointed to by s. The
   length of the string is determined by the first null character using
   Traits::length(s).
   4) Finds the last character equal to ch.
   5) Implicitly converts t to a string view sv as if by std::basic_string_view<CharT,
   Traits> sv = t;, then finds the last substring equal to the contents of sv. This
   overload only participates in overload resolution if std::is_convertible_v<const T&,
   std::basic_string_view<CharT, Traits>> is true and std::is_convertible_v<const T&,
   const CharT*> is false.

   In all cases, equality is checked by calling Traits::eq.

.SH Parameters

   str   - string to search for
   pos   - position at which to begin searching
   count - length of substring to search for
   s     - pointer to a character string to search for
   ch    - character to search for
   t     - object (convertible to std::basic_string_view) to search for

.SH Return value

   Position of the first character of the found substring or npos if no such substring
   is found. Note that this is an offset from the start of the string, not the end.

   If searching for an empty string (str.size(), count, or Traits::length(s) is zero)
   returns pos (the empty string is found immediately) unless pos > size() (including
   the case where pos == npos), in which case returns size().

   Otherwise, if size() is zero, npos is always returned.

   noexcept(std::is_nothrow_convertible_v<const T&, std::basic_string_view<CharT,

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to
   previously published C++ standards.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <string>
 #include <iostream>
  
 void print(std::string::size_type n, std::string const &s)
 {
     if (n == std::string::npos) {
         std::cout << "not found\\n";
     } else {
         std::cout << "found: \\"" << s.substr(n) << "\\" at " << n << '\\n';
     }
 }
  
 int main()
 {
     std::string::size_type n;
     std::string const s = "This is a string";
  
     // search backwards from end of string
     n = s.rfind("is");
     print(n, s);
     // search backwards from position 4
     n = s.rfind("is", 4);
     print(n, s);
     // find a single character
     n = s.rfind('s');
     print(n, s);
     // find a single character
     n = s.rfind('q');
     print(n, s);
 }

 found: "is a string" at 5
 found: "is is a string" at 2
 found: "string" at 10
