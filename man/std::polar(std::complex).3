.SH NAME
std::polar(std::complex) \- std::polar(std::complex)

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <complex>
   template< class T >
   complex<T> polar( const T& r, const T& theta = T());

   Returns a complex number with magnitude r and phase angle theta.

   The behavior is undefined if r is negative or NaN, or if theta is infinite.

.SH Parameters

   r     - magnitude
   theta - phase angle

.SH Return value

   a complex number determined by r and theta

  Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to
   previously published C++ standards.
