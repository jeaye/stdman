.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/ranges/concepts>
   template< class T >                                              (ranges TS)
   concept bool Regular = Semiregular<T> && EqualityComparable<T>;

   The Regular concept specifies that a type is regular, that is, it is copyable,
   default constructible, and equality comparable. It is satisfied by types that behave
   similarly to built-in types like int, and that are comparable with ==.
