.TH std::regex_traits::lookup_classname 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   template< class ForwardIt >

   char_class_type lookup_classname( ForwardIt first,
   ForwardIt last,

   bool icase = false ) const;

   If the character sequence [first, last) represents the name of a valid character
   class in the currently imbued locale (that is, the string between [: and :] in
   regular expressions), returns the implementation-defined value representing this
   character class. Otherwise, returns zero.

   If the parameter icase is true, the character class ignores character case, e.g. the
   regex [:lower:] with std::regex_constants::icase generates a call to
   regex_traits<>::lookup_classname() with [first, last) indicating the string "lower"
   and icase == true. This call returns the same bitmask as the call generated by the
   regex [:alpha:] with icase == false.

   The following character classes are always recognized, in both narrow and wide
   character forms, and the classifications returned (with icase == false) correspond
   to the matching classifications obtained by the std::ctype facet of the imbued
   locale, as follows:

   character class std::ctype classification
   "alnum"         std::ctype_base::alnum
   "alpha"         std::ctype_base::alpha
   "blank"         std::ctype_base::blank
   "cntrl"         std::ctype_base::cntrl
   "digit"         std::ctype_base::digit
   "graph"         std::ctype_base::graph
   "lower"         std::ctype_base::lower
   "print"         std::ctype_base::print
   "punct"         std::ctype_base::punct
   "space"         std::ctype_base::space
   "upper"         std::ctype_base::upper
   "xdigit"        std::ctype_base::xdigit
   "d"             std::ctype_base::digit
   "s"             std::ctype_base::space
   "w"             std::ctype_base::alnum with '_' optionally added

   The classification returned for the string "w" may be exactly the same as "alnum",
   in which case isctype() adds '_' explicitly.

   Additional classifications such as "jdigit" or "jkanji" may be provided by
   system-supplied locales (in which case they are also accessible through std::wctype)

.SH Parameters

   first, last - a pair of iterators which determines the sequence of characters that
                 represents a name of a character class
   icase       - if true, ignores the upper/lower case distinction in the character
                 classification
.SH Type requirements
   -
   ForwardIt must meet the requirements of ForwardIterator.

.SH Return value

   The bitmask representing the character classification determined by the given
   character class, or zero if the class is unknown.

.SH Example

   demonstraits a custom regex_traits implementation of lookup_classname/isctype

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <locale>
 #include <regex>
 #include <cwctype>

 // This custom regex traits uses wctype/iswctype to implement lookup_classname/isctype
 struct wctype_traits : std::regex_traits<wchar_t>
 {
     using char_class_type = std::wctype_t;
     template<class It>
     char_class_type lookup_classname(It first, It last, bool=false) const {
         return std::wctype(std::string(first, last).c_str());
     }
     bool isctype(wchar_t c, char_class_type f) const {
         return std::iswctype(c, f);
     }
 };

 int main()
 {
     std::locale::global(std::locale("ja_JP.utf8"));
     std::wcout.sync_with_stdio(false);
     std::wcout.imbue(std::locale());

     std::wsmatch m;
     std::wstring in = L"風の谷のナウシカ";
     // matches all characters (they are classified as alnum)
     std::regex_search(in, m, std::wregex(L"([[:alnum:]]+)"));
     std::wcout << "alnums: " << m[1] << '\\n'; // prints "風の谷のナウシカ"
     // matches only the kanji
     std::regex_search(in, m,
                       std::basic_regex<wchar_t, wctype_traits>(L"([[:jkata:]]+)"));
     std::wcout << "katakana: " << m[1] << '\\n'; // prints "ナウシカ"
 }

.SH Output:

 alnums: 風の谷のナウシカ
 katakana: ナウシカ
