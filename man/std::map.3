.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <map>
   template<

       class Key,
       class T,
       class Compare = std::less<Key>,
       class Allocator = std::allocator<std::pair<const Key, T> >

   > class map;

   std::map is a sorted associative container that contains key-value pairs with unique
   keys. Keys are sorted by using the comparison function Compare. Search, removal, and
   insertion operations have logarithmic complexity. Maps are usually implemented as
   red-black trees.

   std::map meets the requirements of Container, AllocatorAwareContainer,
   AssociativeContainer and ReversibleContainer.
