std::filesystem::recursive_directory_iterator \- std::filesystem::recursive_directory_iterator

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <filesystem>
   class recursive_directory_iterator;  \fI(since C++17)\fP

   recursive_directory_iterator is a LegacyInputIterator that iterates over the
   directory_entry elements of a directory, and, recursively, over the entries of all
   subdirectories. The iteration order is unspecified, except that each directory entry
   is visited only once.

   By default, symlinks are not followed, but this can be enabled by specifying the
   directory option follow_directory_symlink at construction time.

   The special pathnames dot and dot-dot are skipped.

   If the recursive_directory_iterator reports an error or is advanced past the last
   directory entry of the top-level directory, it becomes equal to the
   default-constructed iterator, also known as the end iterator. Two end iterators are
   always equal, dereferencing or incrementing the end iterator is undefined behavior.

   If a file or a directory is deleted or added to the directory tree after the
   recursive directory iterator has been created, it is unspecified whether the change
   would be observed through the iterator.

   If the directory structure contains cycles, the end iterator may be unreachable.

.SH Non-member functions

   begin(std::filesystem::recursive_directory_iterator) range-based for loop support
   end(std::filesystem::recursive_directory_iterator)   \fI(function)\fP

   Additionally,
   operator== and operator!= are
   \fI(until C++20)\fP
   operator== is
   \fI(since C++20)\fP provided as required by LegacyInputIterator.

   It is unspecified
   whether operator!= is provided because it can be synthesized from operator==, and
   \fI(since C++20)\fP whether an equality operator is a member or non-member.

  Helper templates

   namespace std::ranges {

   template<>
   inline constexpr bool                                                        (since
   enable_borrowed_range<std::filesystem::recursive_directory_iterator> =       C++20)
   true;

   }
   namespace std::ranges {

   template<>                                                                   (since
   inline constexpr bool                                                        C++20)
   enable_view<std::filesystem::recursive_directory_iterator> = true;

   }

   These specializations for recursive_directory_iterator make it a borrowed_range and
   a view.

.SH Notes

   A recursive_directory_iterator typically holds a reference-counted pointer (to
   satisfy shallow-copy semantics of LegacyInputIterator) to an implementation object,
   which holds:

     * a container (such as std::vector) of non-recursive directory_iterators that
       forms the recursion stack
     * the recursion depth counter (accessible with depth())
     * the directory options used at construction (accessible with options())
     * the pending recursion flag (accessible with recursion_pending(), may be combined
       with the directory options to save space)

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <fstream>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <filesystem>
 namespace fs = std::filesystem;

 int main()
 {
     fs::current_path(fs::temp_directory_path());
     fs::create_directories("sandbox/a/b");
     std::ofstream("sandbox/file1.txt");
     fs::create_symlink("a", "sandbox/syma");

     // Iterate over the `std::filesystem::directory_entry` elements explicitly
     for (const fs::directory_entry& dir_entry :
         std::filesystem::recursive_directory_iterator("sandbox"))
     {
         std::cout << dir_entry << '\\n';
     }
     std::cout << "-----------------------------\\n";
     // Iterate over the `std::filesystem::directory_entry` elements using `auto`
     for (auto const& dir_entry : fs::recursive_directory_iterator("sandbox"))
     {
         std::cout << dir_entry << '\\n';
     }

     fs::remove_all("sandbox");
 }

.SH Possible output:

 "sandbox/syma"
 "sandbox/file1.txt"
 "sandbox/a"
 "sandbox/a/b"
 -----------------------------
 "sandbox/syma"
 "sandbox/file1.txt"
 "sandbox/a"
 "sandbox/a/b"
