.SH NAME
std::filesystem::recursive_directory_iterator \- std::filesystem::recursive_directory_iterator

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <filesystem>
   class recursive_directory_iterator;  \fI(since C++17)\fP

   recursive_directory_iterator is an InputIterator that iterates over the
   directory_entry elements of a directory, and, recursively, over the entries of all
   subdirectories. The iteration order is unspecified, except that each directory entry
   is visited only once.

   By default, symlinks are not followed, but this can be enabled by specifying the
   directory option follow_directory_symlink at construction time.

   The special pathnames dot and dot-dot are skipped.

   If the recursive_directory_iterator is advanced past the last directory entry of the
   top-level directory, it becomes equal to the default-constructed iterator, also
   known as the end iterator. Two end iterators are always equal, dereferencing or
   incrementing the end iterator is undefined behavior.

   If a file or a directory is deleted or added to the directory tree after the
   recursive directory iterator has been created, it is unspecified whether the change
   would be observed through the iterator.

   If the directory structure contains cycles, the end iterator may be unreachable.

.SH Non-member functions

   begin(std::filesystem::recursive_directory_iterator) range-based for loop support
   end(std::filesystem::recursive_directory_iterator)   \fI(function)\fP

   Additionally, operator== and operator!= are provided, either as members or as
   non-members, as required by InputIterator

.SH Notes

   A recursive_directory_iterator typically holds a reference-counted pointer (to
   satisfy shallow-copy semantics of InputIterator) to an implementation object, which
   holds:

     * a container (such as std::vector) of non-recursive directory_iterators that
       forms the recursion stack
     * the recursion depth counter (accessible with depth())
     * the directory options used at construction (accessible with options())
     * the pending recursion flag (accessible with recursion_pending(), may be combined
       with the directory options to save space)

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <fstream>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <filesystem>
 namespace fs = std::filesystem;

 int main()
 {
     fs::create_directories("sandbox/a/b");
     std::ofstream("sandbox/file1.txt");
     fs::create_symlink("a", "sandbox/syma");
     for(auto& p: fs::recursive_directory_iterator("sandbox"))
         std::cout << p << '\\n';
     fs::remove_all("sandbox");
 }

.SH Possible output:

 "sandbox/a"
 "sandbox/a/b"
 "sandbox/file1.txt"
 "sandbox/syma"
