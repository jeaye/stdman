.SH NAME
std::ranges::take_while_view::begin \- std::ranges::take_while_view::begin

.SH Synopsis
   constexpr auto begin() requires (!__SimpleView<V>);                \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++20)\fP
   constexpr auto begin() const requires

       ranges::range<const V> &&                                      \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++20)\fP

       std::indirect_unary_predicate<const Pred,
   ranges::iterator_t<const V>>;

   Returns an iterator to the first element of the view. Effectively calls
   ranges::begin on the underlying view.

   Overload \fB(1)\fP does not participate in overload resolution if V is a simple view (that
   is, if V and const V are views with the same iterator and sentinel types).

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   ranges::begin(base_), where base_ is the underlying view.
