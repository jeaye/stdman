.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <ranges>
   template< class T >

   concept SizedRange = Range<T> &&
     ! disable_sized_range<std::remove_cvref_t<T>> && \fB(1)\fP
     requires(T& t) {
       ranges::size(t);

     };
   template<class>                                    \fB(2)\fP
   inline constexpr bool disable_sized_range = false;

   1) The SizedRange concept specifies the requirements of a Range type that knows its
   size in constant time with the size function.

   Formally, given an lvalue t of type std::remove_reference_t<T>, T models SizedRange
   only if

     * ranges::size(t)

     * has non-amortized constant-time complexity,
     * does not modify t, and
     * is equal to ranges::distance(t), and

     * if iterator_t<T> models ForwardIterator, ranges::size(t) is well-defined
       regardless of the evaluation of ranges::begin(t) (in other words, a single-pass
       sized range may support a call to size only before the first call to begin, but
       a forward range must support size at all times)

   2) disable_sized_range exists to allows use of range types that satisfy but do not
   in fact model SizedRange.
