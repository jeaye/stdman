.SH NAME
std::chrono::operator<<(std::chrono::month) \- std::chrono::operator<<(std::chrono::month)

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <chrono>
   template <class CharT, class Traits>

   std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>&                                     \fI(since C++20)\fP

   operator<<(std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& os, const
   std::chrono::month& m);

   If !m.ok(), inserts unsigned(m) followed by " is not a valid month" to os.
   Otherwise, forms a std::basic_string<CharT> s consisting of the abbreviated month
   name for the month represented by m, determined using the locale associated with os,
   and inserts s into os.

   Equivalent to

   return os << (m.ok() ?
   std::format(os.getloc(), STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{:L%b}"), m) :
   std::format(os.getloc(), STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{} is not a valid month"),
   unsigned(m)));

   where STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("...") is "..." if CharT is char, and L"..." if CharT
   is wchar_t.

.SH Return value

   os.

.SH Notes

   This operator<< is primarily intended for debugging use. For control over
   formatting, use std::format.
