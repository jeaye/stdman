   Finds the last character not equal to any of the characters in the given character
   sequence.

   1) Finds the last character not equal to any of the characters of v in this view,
   starting at position pos.
   2) Equivalent to find_last_not_of(basic_string_view(&c, 1), pos).
   3) Equivalent to find_last_not_of(basic_string_view(s, count), pos).
   4) Equivalent to find_last_not_of(basic_string_view(s), pos).

.SH Parameters

   v     - view to search for
   pos   - position at which to start the search
   count - length of the string of characters to compare
   s     - pointer to a string of characters to compare
   ch    - character to compare

.SH Return value

   Position of the last character not equal to any of the characters in the given
   string, or npos if no such character is found.

.SH Complexity

   O(size() * v.size()) at worst.
