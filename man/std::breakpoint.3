.SH NAME
std::breakpoint \- std::breakpoint

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <debugging>
   void breakpoint() noexcept;    (since C++26)

   Unconditional breakpoint: attempts to temporarily halt the execution of the program
   and transfer control to the debugger whether or not it's not possible to determine
   if the debugger is present.

   Formally, the behavior of this function is completely implementation-defined.

.SH Notes

   The intent of this function is allowing for runtime control of breakpoints beyond
   what might be available from a debugger while not causing the program to exit. For
   example, breaking when an infrequent non-critical condition is detected, allowing
   programmatic control with complex runtime sensitive conditions, breaking on user
   input to inspect context in interactive programs without needing to switch to the
   debugger application, etc.

   This function standardizes many similar existing facilities: __builtin_debugtrap
   from LLVM, __debugbreak from Win32 API, debugger_break from boost.test,
   assert(false), _asm { int 3 } (MSVC) and asm("int3") (GCC/clang) for x86 targets,
   etc.
