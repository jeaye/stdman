.SH NAME
std::max_align_t \- std::max_align_t

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstddef>
   typedef /*implementation-defined*/ max_align_t;  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   std::max_align_t is a trivial standard-layout type whose alignment requirement is at
   least as strict (as large) as that of every scalar type.

.SH Notes

   Pointers returned by allocation functions such as std::malloc are suitably aligned
   for any object, which means they are aligned at least as strictly as
   std::max_align_t.

   std::max_align_t is usually synonymous with the largest scalar type, which is long
   double on most platforms, and its alignment requirement is either 8 or 16.

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <cstddef>
 int main()
 {
     std::cout << alignof(std::max_align_t) << '\\n';
 }

.SH Possible output:

 16
