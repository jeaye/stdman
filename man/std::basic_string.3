std::basic_string \- std::basic_string

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <string>
   template<

       class CharT,
       class Traits = std::char_traits<CharT>,
       class Allocator = std::allocator<CharT>

   > class basic_string;

   The class template basic_string stores and manipulates sequences of char-like
   objects. The class is dependent neither on the character type nor on the nature of
   operations on that type. The definitions of the operations are supplied via the
   Traits template parameter - a specialization of std::char_traits or a compatible
   traits class.

   The elements of a basic_string are stored contiguously, that is, for a
   basic_string s, &*(s.begin() + n) == &*s.begin() + n for any n in [0,
   s.size()), or, equivalently, a pointer to s[0] can be passed to        \fI(since C++11)\fP
   functions that expect a pointer to the first element of a CharT[]
   array.

   std::basic_string satisfies the requirements of AllocatorAwareContainer,
   SequenceContainer
   and ContiguousContainer
   \fI(since C++17)\fP

   Several typedefs for common character types are provided:
