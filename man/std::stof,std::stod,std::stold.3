   Interprets a floating point value in a string str.

   1) calls std::strtod(str.c_str(), &ptr) or std::wcstod(str.c_str(),    \fI(until C++17)\fP
   &ptr)
   1) calls std::strtof(str.c_str(), &ptr) or std::wcstof(str.c_str(),    \fI(since C++17)\fP
   &ptr)

   2) calls std::strtod(str.c_str(), &ptr) or std::wcstod(str.c_str(), &ptr)
   3) calls std::strtold(str.c_str(), &ptr) or std::wcstold(str.c_str(), &ptr)

   Function discards any whitespace characters (as determined by std::isspace()) until
   first non-whitespace character is found. Then it takes as many characters as
   possible to form a valid floating-point representation and converts them to a
   floating-point value. The valid floating-point value can be one of the following:

     * decimal floating-point expression. It consists of the following parts:

     * (optional) plus or minus sign
     * nonempty sequence of decimal digits optionally containing decimal-point
       character (as determined by the current C locale) (defines significand)
     * (optional) e or E followed with optional minus or plus sign and nonempty
       sequence of decimal digits (defines exponent)

     * binary floating-point expression. It consists of the following parts:

     * (optional) plus or minus sign
     * 0x or 0X
     * nonempty sequence of hexadecimal digits optionally containing a decimal-point
       character (as determined by the current C locale) (defines significand)
     * (optional) p or P followed with optional minus or plus sign and nonempty
       sequence of decimal digits (defines exponent)

     * infinity expression. It consists of the following parts:

     * (optional) plus or minus sign
     * INF or INFINITY ignoring case

     * not-a-number expression. It consists of the following parts:

     * (optional) plus or minus sign
     * NAN or NAN(char_sequence) ignoring case of the NAN part. char_sequence can only
       contain alphanumeric characters. The result is a quiet NaN floating-point value.

     * any other expression that may be accepted by the currently installed C locale

   If pos is not a null pointer, then a pointer ptr, internal to the conversion
   functions, will receive the address of the first unconverted character in
   str.c_str(), and the index of that character will be calculated and stored in *pos,
   giving the number of characters that were processed by the conversion.

.SH Parameters

   str - the string to convert
   pos - address of an integer to store the number of characters processed

.SH Return value

   The string converted to the specified floating point type.

.SH Exceptions

   std::invalid_argument if no conversion could be performed

   std::out_of_range if the converted value would fall out of the range of the result
   type or if the underlying function (
   strtof,
   \fI(since C++17)\fPstrtod or strtold) sets errno to ERANGE.
