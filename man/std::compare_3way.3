.SH NAME
std::compare_3way \- std::compare_3way

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <algorithm>
   template< class T, class U >                            \fI(since C++20)\fP
   constexpr auto compare_3way( const T& a, const U& b );

   Compares two values using three-way comparison and produces a result of the
   strongest applicable comparison category type.

.SH In detail:

     * If the expression a <=> b is well-formed, returns its result
     * Otherwise, if the expressions a == b and a < b are both well-formed and
       convertible to bool,

     * if a == b equals true, returns std::strong_ordering::equal
     * otherwise, if a < b equals true, returns std::strong_ordering::less
     * otherwise, returns std::strong_ordering::greater

     * Otherwise, if the expression a == b is well-formed and convertible to bool (but
       a < b is not),

     * if a == b equals true, returns std::strong_equality::equal
     * otherwise, returns std::strong_equality::nonequal

     * Otherwise (if neither a <=> b nor a == b are well-formed), the function is
       defined as deleted.

.SH Parameters

   a, b - the values to compare

.SH Return value

   As defined above.

.SH Notes

   This function is useful in generic programming, since it uses < and == as fallbacks
   when <=> is not available.
