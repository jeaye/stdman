.SH Synopsis
   reverse_iterator rend();                        \fI(until C++11)\fP
   reverse_iterator rend() noexcept;               \fI(since C++11)\fP
   const_reverse_iterator rend() const;            \fI(until C++11)\fP
   const_reverse_iterator rend() const noexcept;   \fI(since C++11)\fP
   const_reverse_iterator crend() const noexcept;  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Returns a reverse iterator to the element following the last element of the reversed
   container. It corresponds to the element preceding the first element of the
   non-reversed container. This element acts as a placeholder, attempting to access it
   results in undefined behavior.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   Reverse iterator to the element following the last element.

.SH Complexity

   Constant.

.SH Notes

   Because both iterator and const_iterator are constant iterators (and may in fact be
   the same type), it is not possible to mutate the elements of the container through
   an iterator returned by any of these member functions.
