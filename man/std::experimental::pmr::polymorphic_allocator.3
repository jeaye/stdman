.SH NAME
std::experimental::pmr::polymorphic_allocator \- std::experimental::pmr::polymorphic_allocator

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/memory_resource>
   template< class T >                               (library fundamentals TS)
   class polymorphic_allocator;

   The class template std::experimental::pmr::polymorphic_allocator is an Allocator
   whose allocation behavior depends on the memory resource it is constructed with.
   Thus, different instances of polymorphic_allocator can exhibit entirely different
   allocation behavior. This runtime polymorphism allows objects using
   polymorphic_allocator to behave as if they used different allocator types at run
   time despite the identical static allocator type.
