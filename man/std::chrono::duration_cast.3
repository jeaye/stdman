.SH NAME
std::chrono::duration_cast \- std::chrono::duration_cast

.SH Synopsis
   template <class ToDuration, class Rep, class Period>                \fI(since C++11)\fP
   constexpr ToDuration duration_cast(const duration<Rep,Period>& d);

   Converts a std::chrono::duration to a duration of different type ToDuration.

   No implicit conversions are used. Multiplications and divisions are avoided where
   possible, if it is known at compile time that one or more parameters are 1.
   Computations are done in the widest type available and converted, as if by
   static_cast, to the result type only when finished.

.SH Parameters

   d - duration to convert

.SH Return value

   d converted to a duration of type ToDuration.

.SH Notes

   The function does not participate in the overload resolution unless ToDuration is an
   instance of std::chrono::duration.

   Casting between floating-point durations or between integer durations where the
   source period is exactly divisible by the target period (e.g. hours to minutes) can
   be performed implicitly, no duration_cast is needed.

   Casting from a floating-point duration to an integer duration is subject to
   undefined behavior when the floating-point value is NaN, infinity, or too large to
   be representable by the target's integer type.

.SH Example

   This example measures the execution time of a function

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <chrono>
 #include <ratio>
 #include <thread>

 void f()
 {
     std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
 }

 int main()
 {
     auto t1 = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
     f();
     auto t2 = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

     // integral duration: requires duration_cast
     auto int_ms = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::milliseconds>(t2 - t1);

     // fractional duration: no duration_cast needed
     std::chrono::duration<double, std::milli> fp_ms = t2 - t1;

     std::cout << "f() took " << fp_ms.count() << " ms, "
               << "or " << int_ms.count() << " whole milliseconds\\n";
 }

.SH Possible output:

 f() took 1000.23 ms, or 1000 whole milliseconds
