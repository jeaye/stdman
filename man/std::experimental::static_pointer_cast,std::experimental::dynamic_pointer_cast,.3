.SH Synopsis

   template< class T, class U >                                   (library fundamentals
   std::experimental::shared_ptr<T> static_pointer_cast(      \fB(1)\fP TS)
   const std::experimental::shared_ptr<U>& r ) noexcept;
   template< class T, class U >                                   (library fundamentals
   std::experimental::shared_ptr<T> dynamic_pointer_cast(     \fB(2)\fP TS)
   const std::experimental::shared_ptr<U>& r ) noexcept;
   template< class T, class U >                                   (library fundamentals
   std::experimental::shared_ptr<T> const_pointer_cast( const \fB(3)\fP TS)
   std::experimental::shared_ptr<U>& r ) noexcept;
   template< class T, class U >                                   (library fundamentals
   std::experimental::shared_ptr<T> reinterpret_pointer_cast( \fB(4)\fP TS)
   const std::experimental::shared_ptr<U>& r ) noexcept;

   Creates a new instance of std::experimental::shared_ptr whose stored pointer is
   obtained from r's stored pointer using a cast expression. If r is empty, so is the
   new shared_ptr (but its stored pointer is not necessarily null).

   Otherwise, the new shared_ptr will share ownership with r, except that it is empty
   if the dynamic_cast performed by dynamic_pointer_cast returns a null pointer.

   Let Y be typename std::experimental::shared_ptr<T>::element_type, then the resulting
   std::experimental::shared_ptr's stored pointer will be obtained by calling (in
   respective order):

   1) static_cast<Y*>(r.get()).
   2) dynamic_cast<Y*>(r.get()) (If the result of the dynamic_cast is a null pointer
   value, the returned shared_ptr will be empty).
   3) const_cast<Y*>(r.get()).
   4) reinterpret_cast<Y*>(r.get()).

   The behavior of these functions is undefined unless the corresponding cast from U*
   to T* is well formed:

   1) The behavior is undefined unless static_cast<T*>((U*)nullptr) is well formed.
   2) The behavior is undefined unless dynamic_cast<T*>((U*)nullptr) is well formed.
   3) The behavior is undefined unless const_cast<T*>((U*)nullptr) is well formed.
   4) The behavior is undefined unless reinterpret_cast<T*>((U*)nullptr) is well
   formed.

.SH Parameters
