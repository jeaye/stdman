.SH NAME
std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<T>::deallocate_bytes \- std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<T>::deallocate_bytes

.SH Synopsis
   void deallocate_bytes( void* p,

   std::size_t nbytes,                                   \fI(since C++20)\fP

   std::size_t alignment = alignof(std::max_align_t) );

   Deallocates the storage pointed to by p, which must have been allocated from a
   std::pmr::memory_resource x that compares equal to *resource(). using
   x.allocate(nbytes, alignment), typically through a call to allocate_bytes(nbytes,
   alignment.

   Equivalent to resorce()->deallocate(p, nbytes, alignment);

.SH Parameters

   p         - pointer to memory to deallocate
   nbytes    - the number of bytes originally allocated
   alignment - the alignment originally allocated

.SH Exceptions

   Throws nothing.

.SH Notes

   This function was introduced for use with the fully-specialized allocator
   std::polymorphic_allocator<>, but it may be useful in any specialization.
