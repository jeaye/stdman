.SH NAME
std::future_error \- std::future_error

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <future>
   class future_error;         \fI(since C++11)\fP

   The class std::future_error defines an exception object that is thrown on failure by
   the functions in the thread library that deal with asynchronous execution and shared
   states (std::future, std::promise, etc). Similar to std::system_error, this
   exception carries an error code compatible with std::error_code.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <future>
 #include <iostream>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::future<int> empty;
     try {
         int n = empty.get(); // The behavior is undefined, but
                              // some implementations throw std::future_error
     } catch (const std::future_error& e) {
         std::cout << "Caught a future_error with code \\"" << e.code()
                   << "\\"\\nMessage: \\"" << e.what() << "\\"\\n";
     }
 }

.SH Possible output:

 Caught a future_error with code "future:3"
 Message: "No associated state"
