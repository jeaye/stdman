.SH NAME
std::time_put \- std::time_put

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <locale>
   template<

       class CharT,
       class OutputIt = std::ostreambuf_iterator<CharT>

   > class time_put;

   Class template std::time_put encapsulates date and time formatting rules. The I/O
   manipulator std::put_time uses the std::time_put facet of the I/O stream's locale to
   generate text representation of an std::tm object.

   If a std::time_put specialization is not guaranteed to be provided by the standard
   library (see below), the behaviors of its put() and do_put() are not guaranteed as
   specified.

.SH Specializations

   The standard library is guaranteed to provide the following specializations (they
   are required to be implemented by any locale object):

   Defined in header <locale>
   std::time_put<char>    creates narrow string representations of date and time
   std::time_put<wchar_t> creates wide string representations of date and time

   In addition, the standard library is also guaranteed to provide every specialization
   that satisfies the following type requirements:

     * CharT is one of char and wchar_t, and
     * OutputIt must meet the requirements of LegacyOutputIterator.

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <codecvt>
 #include <ctime>
 #include <iomanip>
 #include <iostream>

 int main()
 {
     std::time_t t = std::time(nullptr);
     std::wbuffer_convert<std::codecvt_utf8<wchar_t>> conv(std::cout.rdbuf());
     std::wostream out(&conv);
     out.imbue(std::locale("ja_JP.utf8"));

     // this I/O manipulator std::put_time uses std::time_put<wchar_t>
     out << std::put_time(std::localtime(&t), L"%A %c") << '\\n';
