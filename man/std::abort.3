.TH std::abort 3 "Sep  4 2015" "2.0 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstdlib>
   void abort();                \fI(until C++11)\fP
   [[noreturn]] void abort();   \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Causes abnormal program termination unless SIGABRT is being caught by a signal
   handler passed to signal and the handler does not return.

   Destructors of variables with automatic, thread local and static storage durations
   are not called. Functions passed to std::atexit() are also not called. Whether open
   resources such as files are closed is implementation defined. Implementation defined
   status is returned to the host environment that indicates unsuccessful execution.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Exceptions

   \fI(none)\fP                  \fI(until C++11)\fP
   noexcept specification: \fI(since C++11)\fP
   noexcept

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <csignal>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <cstdlib>

 class Tester {
 public:
     Tester()  { std::cout << "Tester ctor\\n"; }
     ~Tester() { std::cout << "Tester dtor\\n"; }
 };

 Tester static_tester; // Destructor not called

 void signal_handler(int signal)
 {
     if (signal == SIGABRT) {
         std::cerr << "SIGABRT received\\n";
     } else {
         std::cerr << "Unexpected signal " << signal << " received\\n";
     }
     std::_Exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
 }

 int main()
 {
     Tester automatic_tester; // Destructor not called

     // Setup handler
     auto previous_handler = std::signal(SIGABRT, signal_handler);
     if (previous_handler == SIG_ERR) {
         std::cerr << "Setup failed\\n";
         return EXIT_FAILURE;
     }

     std::abort();  // Raise SIGABRT
     std::cout << "This code is unreachable\\n";
 }

.SH Output:

 Tester ctor
 Tester ctor
 SIGABRT received
