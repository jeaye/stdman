.TH std::basic_ios::copyfmt 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   basic_ios& copyfmt(const basic_ios& other);

   Copies the state of the stream other into *this. This is done in the following
   sequence:

   1) Calls every callback registered by register_callback() passing erase_event as
   parameter
   2) Copies all member objects from other to *this except for rdstate(), the exception
   mask, and rdbuf(). In particular, makes copies of the locale, the formatting flags,
   the contents of the arrays std::ios_base::iword and std::ios_base::pword (but not
   the iword and pword pointers themselves), the callbacks, and the tied stream.
   3) Calls every callback registered by register_callback() passing copyfmt_event as
   parameter
   4) Copies the exception mask from other to *this as if by calling
   exceptions(other.exceptions())

.SH Parameters

   other - another stream to use as source

.SH Return value

   *this

.SH Notes

   The second pass through the callbacks may be used to deep-copy the user-defined
   objects pointed to by the pointers in std::ios_base::pword

   copyfmt() may be used to save and restore the state of a stream. Boost provides a
   more fine-grained IO state savers library for the same purpose.

.SH Example

   makes the ofstream object "out" behave exactly like std::cout, including formatting,
   tie() to std::cin, etc.

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <fstream>

 int main()
 {
     std::ofstream out;

     out.copyfmt(std::cout); // copy everything except rdstate and rdbuf
     out.clear(std::cout.rdstate()); // copy rdstate
     out.basic_ios<char>::rdbuf(std::cout.rdbuf()); // share the buffer

     out << "Hello, world\\n";
 }

.SH Output:

 Hello, world
