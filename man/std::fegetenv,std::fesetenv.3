.SH NAME
std::fegetenv,std::fesetenv \- std::fegetenv,std::fesetenv

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cfenv>
   int fegetenv( std::fenv_t* envp )        \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   int fesetenv( const std::fenv_t* envp ); \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Manages the status of the floating-point environment.

   1) Attempts to store the status of the floating-point environment in the object
   pointed to by envp.
   2) Attempts to establish the floating-point environment from the object pointed to
   by envp. The value of that object must be previously obtained by a call to
   std::feholdexcept or std::fegetenv or be a floating-point macro constant. If any of
   the floating-point status flags are set in envp, they become set in the environment
   (and are then testable with std::fetestexcept), but the corresponding floating-point
   exceptions are not raised (execution continues uninterrupted)

.SH Parameters

   envp - pointer to the object of type std::fenv_t which holds the status of the
          floating-point environment

.SH Return value

   0 on success, non-zero otherwise.
