.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <locale>
   template<

       class CharT,
       class OutputIt = std::ostreambuf_iterator<CharT>

   > class money_put;

   Class std::money_put encapsulates the rules for formatting monetary values as
   strings. The standard I/O manipulator std::put_money uses the std::money_put facet
   of the I/O stream's locale.

   If a std::money_put specialization is not guaranteed to be provided by the standard
   library (see below), the behaviors of its put() and do_put() are not guaranteed as
   specified.

.SH Specializations

   The standard library is guaranteed to provide the following specializations (they
   are required to be implemented by any locale object):

   Defined in header <locale>
   std::money_put<char>    creates narrow string representations of monetary values
   std::money_put<wchar_t> creates wide string representations of monetary values

   In addition, the standard library is also guaranteed to provide every specialization
   that satisfies the following type requirements:

     * CharT is one of
          * char,
          * wchar_t, and
          * any other implementation-defined character container type that meets the
            requirements for a character on which any of the iostream components can be
            instantiated; and
     * OutputIt must meet the requirements of LegacyOutputIterator.

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <iomanip>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <iterator>
 #include <locale>

 int main()
 {
     // using the I/O manipulator
     std::cout.imbue(std::locale("en_US.UTF-8"));
     std::cout << "American locale: "
               << std::showbase << std::put_money(12345678.9) << '\\n';

     // using the facet directly
     std::cout.imbue(std::locale("de_DE.UTF-8"));
     std::cout << "German locale: ";
     auto& f = std::use_facet<std::money_put<char>>(std::cout.getloc());
     f.put({std::cout}, false, std::cout, std::cout.fill(), 12345678.9);
     std::cout << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 American locale: $123,456.79
 German locale: 123.456,79 €
