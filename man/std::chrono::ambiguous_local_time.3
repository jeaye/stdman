.SH NAME
std::chrono::ambiguous_local_time \- std::chrono::ambiguous_local_time

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <chrono>
   class ambiguous_local_time;  \fI(since C++20)\fP

   Defines a type of object to be thrown as exception to report that an attempt was
   made to convert a ambiguous std::chrono::local_time to a std::chrono::sys_time
   without specifying a std::chrono::choose (such as choose::earliest or
   choose::latest).

   This exception is thrown by std::chrono::time_zone::to_sys and functions that call
   it (such as the constructors of std::chrono::zoned_time that takes a
   std::chrono::local_time).

   constructor   constructs the exception object

   template< class Duration >

   ambiguous_local_time(const std::chrono::local_time<Duration>& tp,

                        const std::chrono::local_info& i);

   Constructs the exception object. The explanatory string returned by what() is
   equivalent to that produced by os.str() after the following code:

 std::ostringstream os;
 os << tp << " is ambiguous.  It could be\\n"
    << tp << ' ' << i.first.abbrev << " == "
    << tp - i.first.offset << " UTC or\\n"
    << tp << ' ' << i.second.abbrev  << " == "
    << tp - i.second.offset  << " UTC";

   Because copying a standard library class derived from std::exception is not
   permitted to throw exceptions, this message is typically stored internally as a
   separately-allocated reference-counted string.

   The behavior is undefined if i.result != std::chrono::local_info::ambiguous.

.SH Parameters

   tp - the time point for which conversion was attempted
   i  - a std::chrono::local_info describing the result of the conversion attempt

.SH Exceptions

   May throw std::bad_alloc
