   Transforms each element in the range [first, last) with unary_op, then computes an
   inclusive prefix sum operation using binary_op over the resulting range, optionally
   with init as the initial value, and writes the results to the range beginning at
   d_first. "inclusive" means that the i-th input element is included in the i-th sum.

   Formally, assigns through each iterator i in [d_first, d_first + (last - first)) the
   value of

     * for overloads (1-2), the generalized noncommutative sum of unary_op(*j)... for
       every j in [first, first + (i - d_first + 1)) over binary_op,
     * for overloads (3-4), the generalized noncommutative sum of init, unary_op(*j)...
       for every j in [first, first + (i - d_first + 1)) over binary_op,

   where generalized noncommutative sum GNSUM(op, a
   1, ..., a
   N) is defined as follows:

     * if N=1, a
       1
     * if N > 1, op(GNSUM(op, a
       1, ..., a
       K), GNSUM(op, a
       M, ..., a
       N)) for any K where 1 < K+1 = M ≤ N

   In other words, the summation operations may be performed in arbitrary order, and
   the behavior is nondeterministic if binary_op is not associative.

   Overloads (2, 4) are executed according to policy, and do not participate in
   overload resolution unless std::is_execution_policy_v<std::decay_t<ExecutionPolicy>>
   is true.

   unary_op and binary_op shall not invalidate iterators (including the end iterators)
   or subranges, nor modify elements in the ranges [first, last) or [d_first, d_first +
   (last - first)). Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

.SH Parameters

   first, last         -         the range of elements to sum
   d_first             -         the beginning of the destination range; may be equal
                                 to first
   policy              -         the execution policy to use. See execution policy for
                                 details.
   init                -         the initial value
                                 unary FunctionObject that will be applied to each
   unary_op            -         element of the input range. The return type must be
                                 acceptable as input to binary_op.
                                 binary FunctionObject that will be applied in to the
   binary_op           -         result of unary_op, the results of other binary_op,
                                 and init if provided.
.SH Type requirements
   -
   InputIt must meet the requirements of InputIterator.
   -
   OutputIt must meet the requirements of OutputIterator.
   -
   ForwardIt1 must meet the requirements of ForwardIterator. and, if init is not
   provided, ForwardIt1's value_type must be MoveConstructible and
   binary_op(unary_op(*first), unary_op(*first)) must be convertible to ForwardIt1's
   value type
   -
   ForwardIt2 must meet the requirements of ForwardIterator.
   -
   T (if init is provided) must meet the requirements of MoveConstructible. All of
   binary_op(init, unary_op(*first)), binary_op(init, init), and
   binary_op(unary_op(*first), unary_op(*first)) must be convertible to T

.SH Return value

   Iterator to the element past the last element written.

.SH Complexity

   O(last - first) applications of each of binary_op and unary_op.

.SH Exceptions

   The overloads with a template parameter named ExecutionPolicy report errors as
   follows:

     * If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws an exception
       and ExecutionPolicy is one of the three standard policies, std::terminate is
       called. For any other ExecutionPolicy, the behavior is implementation-defined.
     * If the algorithm fails to allocate memory, std::bad_alloc is thrown.

.SH Notes

   unary_op is not applied to init.

   The parameter init appears last, differing from std::transform_exclusive_scan,
   because it is optional for this function.
