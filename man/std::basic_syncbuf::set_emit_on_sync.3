.SH NAME
std::basic_syncbuf::set_emit_on_sync \- std::basic_syncbuf::set_emit_on_sync

.SH Synopsis
   void set_emit_on_sync( bool b ) noexcept;

   Changes the current emit-on-sync policy.

   The value false (the default) indicates that any flush will be postponed until a
   call to emit.

   The value true makes flushes apply immediately.

.SH Parameters

   b - new value for the emit-on-sync policy

.SH Notes

   In a future C++20 draft, it is expected that I/O manipulators will be provided to
   change this policy though an instance of std::basic_osyncstream.
