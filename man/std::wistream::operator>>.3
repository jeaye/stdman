   Extracts values from an input stream.

   1-4) Extracts an integer value potentially skipping preceding whitespace. The value
   is stored to a given reference value.
   This function behaves as a FormattedInputFunction. After constructing and checking
   the sentry object, which may skip leading whitespace, extracts an integer value by
   calling std::num_get::get().
   5) Extracts a floating-point value potentially skipping preceding whitespace. The
   value is stored to a given reference value.
   This function behaves as a FormattedInputFunction. After constructing and checking
   the sentry object, which may skip leading whitespace, extracts a floating-point
   value by calling std::num_get::get().
   6) Extracts a boolean value potentially skipping preceding whitespace. The value is
   stored to a given reference value.
   This function behaves as a FormattedInputFunction. After constructing and checking
   the sentry object, which may skip leading whitespace, extracts an bool value by
   calling std::num_get::get().
   7) Extracts a generic pointer value potentially skipping preceding whitespace. The
   value is stored to a given reference value.
   This function behaves as a FormattedInputFunction. After constructing and checking
   the sentry object, which may skip leading whitespace, extracts a generic pointer
   value by calling std::num_get::get().
   8-10) Calls func(*this), where func is an I/O manipulator.
   11) Behaves as an UnformattedInputFunction. After constructing and checking the
   sentry object, extracts all data from the input stream and stores it to sb. The
   extraction stops if one of the following conditions are met:

              * end-of-file occurs on the input sequence;
              * inserting in the output sequence fails (in which case the character to
                be inserted is not extracted);
              * an exception occurs (in which case the exception is caught, and only
                rethrown if failbit is enabled in exceptions()).

   In either case, stores the number of characters extracted in the member variable
   accessed by subsequent calls to gcount(). If sb is a null pointer or if no
   characters were inserted into sb, calls setstate(failbit) (which may throw
   std::ios_base::failure if enabled).

   If extraction fails (e.g. if a letter was entered where a digit is expected), zero
   is written to value and failbit is set. For signed integers, if extraction results
   in the value too large or too small to fit in value, std::numeric_limits<T>::max()
   or std::numeric_limits<T>::min() (respectively) is written and failbit flag is set.
   For unsigned integers, if extraction results in the value too large or too small to
   fit in value, std::numeric_limits<T>::max() is written and failbit flag is set.

.SH Parameters

   value - reference to an integer or floating-point value to store the extracted value
           to
   func  - pointer to I/O manipulator function
   sb    - pointer to the streambuffer to write all the data to

.SH Return value

   1-9,11) *this
   10) func(*this)

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <iomanip>
 #include <sstream>

 int main()
 {
     std::string input = "41 3.14 false hello world";
     std::istringstream stream(input);
     int n;
     double f;
     bool b;

     stream >> n >> f >> std::boolalpha >> b;
     std::cout << "n = " << n << '\\n'
               << "f = " << f << '\\n'
               << "b = " << std::boolalpha << b << '\\n';

     // extract the rest using the streambuf overload
     stream >> std::cout.rdbuf();
     std::cout << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 n = 41
 f = 3.14
 b = false
 hello world
