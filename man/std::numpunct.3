.TH std::numpunct 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <locale>
   template< class CharT >
   class numpunct;

   The facet std::numpunct encapsulates numeric punctuation preferences. Stream I/O
   operations use std::numpunct through std::num_get and std::num_put for parsing
   numeric input and formatting numeric output.

   The numbers that are supported by std::numpunct have the format described below.
   Here digit represents the radix set specified by the fmtflags argument value,
   thousands-sep and decimal-point are the results of thousands_sep() and
   decimal_point() functions respectively. The format of integer values is as follows:

 integer     ::= [sign] units
 sign        ::= plusminus
 plusminus   ::= '+' | '-'
 units       ::= digits [thousands-sep units]
 digits      ::= digit [digits]

   The number of digits between the thousand-seps (maximum size of digits) is specified
   by the result of grouping().

   The format of floating-point values is as follows:

 floatval    ::= [sign] units [decimal-point [digits]] [e [sign] digits] |
                 [sign]        decimal-point  digits   [e [sign] digits]
 e           ::= ’e’ | ’E’

   Two standalone (locale-independent) specializations are provided by the standard
   library:

   Defined in header <locale>
   std::numpunct<char>    provides equivalents of the "C" locale preferences
   std::numpunct<wchar_t> provides wide character equivalents of the "C" locale
                          preferences

   In addition, every locale object constructed in a C++ program implements its own
   (locale-specific) versions of these specializations.

.SH Example

   The following example changes the string representations of true and false

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <locale>

 struct french_bool : std::numpunct<char> {
     string_type do_truename() const { return "oui"; }
     string_type do_falsename() const { return "non"; }
 };

 int main()
 {
     std::cout << "default locale: "
               << std::boolalpha << true << ", " << false << '\\n';
     std::cout.imbue(std::locale(std::cout.getloc(), new french_bool));
     std::cout << "locale with modified numpunct: "
               << std::boolalpha << true << ", " << false << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 default locale: true, false
 locale with modified numpunct: oui, non
