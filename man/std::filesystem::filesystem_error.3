.SH NAME
std::filesystem::filesystem_error \- std::filesystem::filesystem_error

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <filesystem>
   class filesystem_error;         \fI(since C++17)\fP

   The class std::filesystem::filesystem_error defines an exception object that is
   thrown on failure by the throwing overloads of the functions in the filesystem
   library.

.SH Notes

   In order to ensure that copy functions of filesystem_error are noexcept, typical
   implementations store an object holding the return value of what() and two
   std::filesystem::path objects referenced by path1() and path2() respectively in a
   separately-allocated reference-counted storage.

   Currently the MS STL implementation is non-conforming: objects mentioned above are
   stored directly in the filesystem object, which makes the copy functions not
   noexcept.

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <system_error>
 #include <filesystem>
 #include <iostream>

 int main()
 {
     const std::filesystem::path from{"/nonexistent1/a"}, to{"/nonexistent2/b"};
     try {
         std::filesystem::copy_file(from, to); // throws: files do not exist
     }
     catch(std::filesystem::filesystem_error const& ex) {
         std::cout
             << "what():  " << ex.what() << '\\n'
             << "path1(): " << ex.path1() << '\\n'
             << "path2(): " << ex.path2() << '\\n'
             << "code().value():    " << ex.code().value() << '\\n'
             << "code().message():  " << ex.code().message() << '\\n'
             << "code().category(): " << ex.code().category().name() << '\\n';
     }

     // All functions have non-throwing equivalents
     std::error_code ec;
     std::filesystem::copy_file(from, to, ec); // does not throw
     std::cout << "\\nnon-throwing form sets error_code: " << ec.message() << '\\n';
 }

.SH Possible output:

 what():  filesystem error: cannot copy file: No such file or directory [/nonexistent1/a] [/nonexistent2/b]
 path1(): "/nonexistent1/a"
 path2(): "/nonexistent2/b"
 code().value():    2
 code().message():  No such file or directory
 code().category(): generic

 non-throwing form sets error_code: No such file or directory
