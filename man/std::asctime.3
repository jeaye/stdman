.TH std::asctime 3 "Nov 25 2015" "2.0 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::asctime \- std::asctime

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <ctime>
   char* asctime( const std::tm* time_ptr );

   Converts given calendar time std::tm to a textual representation of the following
   fixed 25-character form: Www Mmm dd hh:mm:ss yyyy\\n

     * Www - three-letter English abbreviated day of the week from time_ptr->tm_wday,
       one of Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun.
     * Mmm - three-letter English abbreviated month name from time_ptr->tm_mon, one of
       Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec.
     * dd - 2-digit day of the month from timeptr->tm_mday as if printed by sprintf
       using %2d
     * hh - 2-digit hour from timeptr->tm_hour as if printed by sprintf using %.2d
     * mm - 2-digit minute from timeptr->tm_min as if printed by sprintf using %.2d
     * ss - 2-digit second from timeptr->tm_sec as if printed by sprintf using %.2d
     * yyyy - 4-digit year from timeptr->tm_year + 1900 as if printed by sprintf using
       %4d

   The behavior is undefined if any member of *time_ptr is outside its normal range

   The behavior is undefined if the calendar year indicated by time_ptr->tm_year has
   more than 4 digits or is less than the year 1000.

   The function does not support localization, and the newline character cannot be
   removed.

   The function modifies static storage and is not thread-safe.

.SH Parameters

   time_ptr - pointer to a std::tm object specifying the time to print

.SH Return value

   Pointer to a static null-terminated character string holding the textual
   representation of date and time. The string may be shared between std::asctime and
   std::ctime, and may be overwritten on each invocation of any of those functions.

.SH Notes

   This function returns a pointer to static data and is not thread-safe. POSIX marks
   this function obsolete and recommends std::strftime instead.

   POSIX limits undefined behaviors only to when the output string would be longer than
   25 characters, when timeptr->tm_wday or timeptr->tm_mon are not within the expected
   ranges, or when timeptr->tm_year exceeds INT_MAX-1990.

   Some implementations handle timeptr->tm_mday==0 as meaning the last day of the
   preceding month.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <ctime>
 #include <iostream>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::time_t result = std::time(NULL);
     std::cout << std::asctime(std::localtime(&result));
 }

.SH Output:

 Tue Dec 27 16:45:52 2011
