.SH NAME
std::shared_future::wait_for \- std::shared_future::wait_for

.SH Synopsis
   template< class Rep, class Period >
   std::future_status wait_for( const std::chrono::duration<Rep,Period>&  \fI(since C++11)\fP
   timeout_duration ) const;

   Waits for the result to become available. Blocks until specified timeout_duration
   has elapsed or the result becomes available, whichever comes first. Returns value
   identifies the state of the result.

   A steady clock is used to measure the duration. This function may block for longer
   than timeout_duration due to scheduling or resource contention delays.

   The behavior is undefined if valid()== false before the call to this function.

.SH Parameters

   timeout_duration - maximum duration to block for

.SH Return value

   Constant                Explanation
   future_status::deferred The function to calculate the result has not been started
                           yet
   future_status::ready    The result is ready
   future_status::timeout  The timeout has expired

.SH Exceptions

   Any exception thrown by clock, time_point, or duration during the execution (clocks,
   time points, and durations provided by the standard library never throw)

.SH Notes

   The implementations are encouraged to detect the case when valid == false before the
   call and throw a future_error with an error condition of future_errc::no_state.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <future>
 #include <thread>
 #include <chrono>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::shared_future<int> future = std::async(std::launch::async, [](){
         std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(3));
         return 8;
     });
  
     std::cout << "waiting...\\n";
     std::future_status status;
     do {
         status = future.wait_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
         if (status == std::future_status::deferred) {
             std::cout << "deferred\\n";
         } else if (status == std::future_status::timeout) {
             std::cout << "timeout\\n";
         } else if (status == std::future_status::ready) {
             std::cout << "ready!\\n";
         }
     } while (status != std::future_status::ready);
  
     std::cout << "result is " << future.get() << '\\n';
 }

.SH Possible output:

 waiting...
 timeout
 timeout
 ready!
 result is 8
