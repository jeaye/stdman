.SH NAME
std::mutex::mutex \- std::mutex::mutex

.SH Synopsis
   constexpr mutex();              \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   mutex( const mutex& ) = delete; \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   1) Constructs the mutex. The mutex is in unlocked state after the constructor
   completes.
   2) Copy constructor is deleted.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Exceptions

   noexcept specification:
   noexcept

.SH Notes

   Because the default constructor is constexpr, static mutexes are initialized as part
   of static non-local initialization, before any dynamic non-local initialization
   begins. This makes it safe to lock a mutex in a constructor of any static object.
