.TH std::mutex::mutex 3 "2024.06.10" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::mutex::mutex \- std::mutex::mutex

.SH Synopsis
   constexpr mutex() noexcept;     \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   mutex( const mutex& ) = delete; \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   1) Constructs the mutex. The mutex is in unlocked state after the constructor
   completes.
   2) Copy constructor is deleted.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Notes

   Because the default constructor is constexpr, static mutexes are initialized as part
   of static non-local initialization, before any dynamic non-local initialization
   begins. This makes it safe to lock a mutex in a constructor of any static object.
