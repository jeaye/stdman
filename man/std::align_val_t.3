.SH NAME
std::align_val_t \- std::align_val_t

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <new>
   enum class align_val_t : std::size_t {};  \fI(since C++17)\fP

   Both new-expression and delete-expression, when used with objects whose alignment
   requirement is greater than __STDCPP_DEFAULT_NEW_ALIGNMENT__, pass that alignment
   requirement as an argument of type std::align_val_t to the selected
   allocation/deallocation function.

.SH Notes

   Alignment (as obtained by alignof) has the type std::size_t, but placement forms of
   allocation and deallocation functions that take std::size_t as an additional
   parameter are already in use, so this type is used instead.

   operator delete   deallocation functions
