.SH NAME
std::shared_mutex::unlock \- std::shared_mutex::unlock

.SH Synopsis
   void unlock();  \fI(since C++17)\fP

   Unlocks the mutex.

   The mutex must be locked by the current thread of execution, otherwise, the behavior
   is undefined.

   This operation synchronizes-with (as defined in std::memory_order) any subsequent
   lock operation that obtains ownership of the same mutex.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Exceptions

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Notes

   unlock() is usually not called directly: std::unique_lock and std::lock_guard are
   used to manage exclusive locking.
