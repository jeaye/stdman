std::chrono::utc_clock::from_sys \- std::chrono::utc_clock::from_sys

.SH Synopsis
   template <class Duration>

   static std::chrono::utc_time<std::common_type_t<Duration,              \fI(since C++20)\fP
   std::chrono::seconds>>

   from_sys(const std::chrono::sys_time<Duration>& t);

   Converts a sys_time t to a utc_time u that represents the same point in time.

   u.time_since_epoch() - t.time_since_epoch() is equal to the number of leap seconds
   that was inserted between t and 1 January 1970. If t is the exact date of a leap
   second insertion, that leap second is counted as inserted.

.SH Return value

   A utc_time representing the same point in time as t.
