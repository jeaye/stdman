.SH Synopsis
   priority_queue<T, Container>&                          \fB(1)\fP
   operator=( const priority_queue<T,Container>& other );
   priority_queue<T, Container>&                          \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   operator=( priority_queue<T,Container>&& other );

   Replaces the contents of the container adaptor with those of other.

   1) Copy assignment operator. Replaces the contents with a copy of the contents of
   other. Effectively calls c = other.c;. (implicitly declared)
   2) Move assignment operator. Replaces the contents with those of other using move
   semantics. Effectively calls c = std::move(other.c); (implicitly declared)

.SH Parameters

   other - another container adaptor to be used as source

.SH Return value

   *this

.SH Complexity

   Equivalent to that of operator= of the underlying container.
