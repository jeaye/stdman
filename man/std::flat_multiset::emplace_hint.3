.SH NAME
std::flat_multiset::emplace_hint \- std::flat_multiset::emplace_hint

.SH Synopsis
   template< class... Args >                                      (since C++23)
   iterator emplace_hint( const_iterator hint, Args&&... args );

   Inserts a new element into the container as close as possible to the position just
   before hint.

   The constructors of the key and mapped value are called with exactly the same
   arguments as supplied to the function, forwarded with std::forward<Args>(args)....

    Information on iterator invalidation is copied from here

.SH Parameters

   hint - iterator to the position before which the new element will be inserted
   args - arguments to forward to the constructor of the element

.SH Return value

   An iterator to the inserted element.

.SH Exceptions

   exception safety guarantee).
