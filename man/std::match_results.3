.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <regex>
   template<

   class BidirIt,                                        \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   class Alloc = std::allocator<std::sub_match<BidirIt>>

   template <class BidirIt>
   using match_results = std::match_results<BidirIt,     \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<
   std::sub_match<BidirIt>>>;

   }

   The class template std::match_results holds a collection of character sequences that
   represent the result of a regular expression match.

   This is a specialized allocator-aware container. It can only be default created,
   obtained from std::regex_iterator, or modified by std::regex_search or
   std::regex_match. Because std::match_results holds std::sub_matches, each of which
   is a pair of iterators into the original character sequence that was matched, it's
   undefined behavior to examine std::match_results if the original character sequence
   was destroyed or iterators to it were invalidated for other reasons.

   The first sub_match (index 0) contained in a match_result always represents the full
   match within a target sequence made by a regex, and subsequent sub_matches represent
   sub-expression matches corresponding in sequence to the left parenthesis delimiting
   the sub-expression in the regex.

   std::match_results meets the requirements of a AllocatorAwareContainer and of a
   SequenceContainer, except that only copy assignment, move assignment, and operations
   defined for a constant containers are supported, and that the semantics of
   comparison functions are different from those required for a container.

.SH Type requirements

   -
   BidirIt must meet the requirements of LegacyBidirectionalIterator.
