.SH NAME
std::ranges::greater_equal \- std::ranges::greater_equal

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <functional>
   struct greater_equal;           \fI(since C++20)\fP

   Function object for performing comparisons. Deduces the parameter types of the
   function call operator from the arguments (but not the return type).

.SH Member types

   Member type    Definition
   is_transparent /* unspecified */

.SH Member functions

   operator() checks if the first argument is greater than or equal to the second
              \fI(public member function)\fP

std::ranges::greater_equal::operator()

   template< class T, class U >

   requires StrictTotallyOrderedWith<T, U> ||
   /* std::declval<T>() < std::declval<U>() resolves to
   a built-in operator comparing pointers */

   constexpr bool operator()(T&& t, U&& u) const;

   Compares t and u. Equivalent to return !ranges::less{}(std::forward<T>(t),
   std::forward<U>(u));.

.SH Notes

   Unlike std::greater_equal, std::ranges::greater_equal requires all six comparison
   operators <, <=, >, >=, == and != to be valid (via the StrictTotallyOrderedWith
   constraint) and is entirely defined in terms of std::ranges::less. However, the
   implementation is free to use operator>= directly, because those concepts require
   the results of the comparison operators to be consistent.
