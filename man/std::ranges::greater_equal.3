.SH NAME
std::ranges::greater_equal \- std::ranges::greater_equal

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <functional>
   struct greater_equal;           \fI(since C++20)\fP

   Function object for performing comparisons. Deduces the parameter types of the
   function call operator from the arguments (but not the return type).

  Implementation-defined strict total order over pointers

   The function call operator yields the implementation-defined strict total order over
   pointers if the < operator between arguments invokes a built-in comparison operator
   for a pointer, even if the built-in < operator does not.

   The implementation-defined strict total order is consistent with the partial order
   imposed by built-in comparison operators (<=>, <, >, <=, and >=), and consistent
   among following standard function objects:

     * std::less, std::greater, std::less_equal, and std::greater_equal, when the
       template argument is a pointer type or void

     * std::ranges::equal_to, std::ranges::not_equal_to, std::ranges::less,
       std::ranges::greater, std::ranges::less_equal, std::ranges::greater_equal, and
       std::compare_three_way

std::ranges::greater_equal::operator()

   template< class T, class U >

   requires std::totally_ordered_with<T, U> // with different semantic requirements

   constexpr bool operator()(T&& t, U&& u) const;

   Compares t and u. Equivalent to return !ranges::less{}(std::forward<T>(t),
   std::forward<U>(u));.

.SH Notes

   Unlike std::greater_equal, std::ranges::greater_equal requires all six comparison
   operators <, <=, >, >=, == and != to be valid (via the totally_ordered_with
   constraint) and is entirely defined in terms of std::ranges::less.
