.SH NAME
std::experimental::source_location::current \- std::experimental::source_location::current

.SH Synopsis
   static constexpr source_location current() noexcept;  (library fundamentals TS v2)

   Constructs a new source_location object.

.SH Return value

   If current() is invoked directly (via a function call that names current()), it
   returns a source_location object with implementation-defined values representing the
   location of the call. The values should be affected by the #line preprocessor
   directive in the same manner as the predefined macros __LINE__ and __FILE__.

   If current() is invoked in any other manner, the return value is unspecified.

   Remarks

   If current() is used in an initializer for a non-static data member, the return
   value corresponds to the location of the constructor or aggregate initialization
   that initializes the data member.

.SH Notes

   When current() is used in a default argument, the return value will correspond to
   the location of the call to current() at the call site.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP
