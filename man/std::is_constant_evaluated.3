.SH NAME
std::is_constant_evaluated \- std::is_constant_evaluated

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <type_traits>
   constexpr bool is_constant_evaluated() noexcept;  \fI(since C++20)\fP

   Detects whether the function call occurs within a constant-evaluated context.
   Returns true if the evaluation of the call occurs within the evaluation of an
   expression or conversion that is manifestly constant-evaluated; otherwise returns
   false.

   The following expressions (including conversions to the destination type) are
   manifestly constant-evaluated:

     * Where a constant expression is grammatically required, including:

     * array bounds
     * the dimensions in new-expressions other than the first
     * bit-field lengths
     * enumeration initializers
     * alignments
     * case expressions
     * non-type template arguments
     * expressions in noexcept specifications
     * expressions in static_assert declarations
     * expressions in conditional explicit specifiers

     * conditions of constexpr if statements
     * immediate invocations
     * constraint expressions in concept definitions, nested requirements, and requires
       clauses
     * initializers of variables that are usable in constant expressions, including:

     * initializers of constexpr variables
     * initializers of variables with reference type or const-qualified integral or
       enumeration type, when the initializers are constant expressions

     * initializers of static and thread local variables, when all subexpressions of
       the initializers (including constructor calls and implicit conversions) are
       constant expressions (that is, when the initializers are constant initializers)

   To test the last two conditions, compilers may first perform a trial constant
   evaluation of the initializers. It is not recommended to depend on the result in
   this case.

 int y;
 const int a = std::is_constant_evaluated() ? y : 1;
 // Trial constant evaluation fails. The constant evaluation is discarded.
 // Variable a is dynamically initialized with 1
  
 const int b = std::is_constant_evaluated() ? 2 : y;
 // Constant evaluation with std::is_constant_evaluation() == true succeeds.
 // Variable b is statically initialized with 2

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   true if the evaluation of the call occurs within the evaluation of an expression or
   conversion that is manifestly constant-evaluated; otherwise false

.SH Notes

   When directly used as the condition of static_assert declaration or constexpr if
   statement, std::is_constant_evaluated() always returns true.
