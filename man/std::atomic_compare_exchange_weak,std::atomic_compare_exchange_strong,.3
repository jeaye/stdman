   Atomically compares the
   object representation
   \fI(until C++20)\fP
   value representation
   \fI(since C++20)\fP of the object pointed to by obj with that of the object pointed to by
   expected, and if those are bitwise-equal, replaces the former with desired (performs
   read-modify-write operation). Otherwise, loads the actual value pointed to by obj
   into *expected (performs load operation). Copying is performed as if by std::memcpy.

   The memory models for the read-modify-write and load operations are succ and fail
   respectively. The (1-2) versions use std::memory_order_seq_cst by default.

   These functions are defined in terms of member functions of std::atomic:

   1) obj->compare_exchange_weak(*expected, desired)
   2) obj->compare_exchange_strong(*expected, desired)
   3) obj->compare_exchange_weak(*expected, desired, succ, fail)
   4) obj->compare_exchange_strong(*expected, desired, succ, fail)

.SH Parameters

   obj      - pointer to the atomic object to test and modify
   expected - pointer to the value expected to be found in the atomic object
   desired  - the value to store in the atomic object if it is as expected
   succ     - the memory synchronization ordering for the read-modify-write operation
              if the comparison succeeds. All values are permitted.
              the memory synchronization ordering for the load operation if the
              comparison fails. Cannot be std::memory_order_release or
   fail     - std::memory_order_acq_rel
              and cannot specify stronger ordering than succ
              \fI(until C++17)\fP

.SH Return value

   The result of the comparison: true if *obj was equal to *expected, false otherwise.

.SH Notes

   The weak forms (\fB(1)\fP and \fB(3)\fP) of the functions are allowed to fail spuriously, that
   is, act as if *obj != *expected even if they are equal. When a compare-and-exchange
   is in a loop, the weak version will yield better performance on some platforms.

   When a weak compare-and-exchange would require a loop and a strong one would not,
   the strong one is preferable unless the object representation of T may include
   padding bits,
   \fI(until C++20)\fP trap bits, or offers multiple object representations for the same
   value (e.g. floating-point NaN). In those cases, weak compare-and-exchange typically
   works because it quickly converges on some stable object representation.

   For a union with bits that participate in the value representations of some members
   but not the others, compare-and-exchange might always fail because such padding bits
   have indeterminate values when they do not participate in the value representation
   of the active member.

   Padding bits that never participate in an object's value               \fI(since C++20)\fP
   representation are ignored.

.SH Example

   compare and exchange operations are often used as basic building blocks of lockfree
   data structures


// Run this code

 #include <atomic>

 template<class T>
 struct node
 {
     T data;
     node* next;
     node(const T& data) : data(data), next(nullptr) {}
 };

 template<class T>
 class stack
 {
     std::atomic<node<T>*> head;
  public:
     void push(const T& data)
     {
         node<T>* new_node = new node<T>(data);

         // put the current value of head into new_node->next
         new_node->next = head.load(std::memory_order_relaxed);

         // now make new_node the new head, but if the head
         // is no longer what's stored in new_node->next
         // (some other thread must have inserted a node just now)
         // then put that new head into new_node->next and try again
         while(!std::atomic_compare_exchange_weak_explicit(
                                 &head,
                                 &new_node->next,
                                 new_node,
                                 std::memory_order_release,
                                 std::memory_order_relaxed))
                 ; // the body of the loop is empty
 // note: the above loop is not thread-safe in at least
 // GCC prior to 4.8.3 (bug 60272), clang prior to 2014-05-05 (bug 18899)
 // MSVC prior to 2014-03-17 (bug 819819). See member function version for workaround
