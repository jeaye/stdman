   bool
   atomic_compare_exchange_strong_explicit(
   volatile std::atomic<T>* obj,
   T* expected, T desired,
   std::memory_order succ,

   std::memory_order fail );

   Atomically compares the object representation of the object pointed to by obj with
   the object representation of the object pointed to by expected, as if by
   std::memcmp, and if those are bitwise-equal, replaces the former with desired
   (performs read-modify-write operation). Otherwise, loads the actual value pointed to
   by obj into *expected (performs load operation). Copying is performed as if by
   std::memcpy.

   The memory models for the read-modify-write and load operations are succ and fail
   respectively. The (1-2) versions use std::memory_order_seq_cst by default.

   These functions are defined in terms of member functions of std::atomic:

   1) obj->compare_exchange_weak(*expected, desired)
   2) obj->compare_exchange_strong(*expected, desired)
   3) obj->compare_exchange_weak(*expected, desired, succ, fail)
   4) obj->compare_exchange_strong(*expected, desired, succ, fail)

.SH Parameters

   obj      - pointer to the atomic object to test and modify
   expected - pointer to the value expected to be found in the atomic object
   desired  - the value to store in the atomic object if it is as expected
   succ     - the memory synchronization ordering for the read-modify-write operation
              if the comparison succeeds. All values are permitted.
              the memory synchronization ordering for the load operation if the
              comparison fails. Cannot be std::memory_order_release or
   fail     - std::memory_order_acq_rel
              and cannot specify stronger ordering than succ
              \fI(until C++17)\fP

.SH Return value

   The result of the comparison: true if *obj was equal to *expected, false otherwise.

.SH Exceptions

   noexcept specification:
   noexcept

.SH Notes

   The weak forms (\fB(1)\fP and \fB(3)\fP) of the functions are allowed to fail spuriously, that
   is, act as if *obj != *expected even if they are equal. When a compare-and-exchange
   is in a loop, the weak version will yield better performance on some platforms.

   When a weak compare-and-exchange would require a loop and a strong one would not,
   the strong one is preferable unless the object representation of T may include
   padding bits, trap bits, or offers multiple object representations for the same
   value (e.g. floating-point NaN). In those cases, weak compare-and-exchange typically
   works because it quickly converges on some stable object representation.

.SH Example

   compare and exchange operations are often used as basic building blocks of lockfree
   data structures

   
// Run this code

 #include <atomic>

 template<class T>
 struct node
 {
     T data;
     node* next;
     node(const T& data) : data(data), next(nullptr) {}
 };

 template<class T>
 class stack
 {
     std::atomic<node<T>*> head;
  public:
     void push(const T& data)
     {
         node<T>* new_node = new node<T>(data);

         // put the current value of head into new_node->next
         new_node->next = head.load(std::memory_order_relaxed);

         // now make new_node the new head, but if the head
         // is no longer what's stored in new_node->next
         // (some other thread must have inserted a node just now)
         // then put that new head into new_node->next and try again
         while(!std::atomic_compare_exchange_weak_explicit(
                                 &head,
                                 &new_node->next,
                                 new_node,
                                 std::memory_order_release,
                                 std::memory_order_relaxed))
                 ; // the body of the loop is empty
 // note: the above loop is not thread-safe in at least
 // GCC prior to 4.8.3 (bug 60272), clang prior to 2014-05-05 (bug 18899)
 // MSVC prior to 2014-03-17 (bug 819819). See member function version for workaround
