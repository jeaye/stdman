.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <typeinfo>
   class type_info;

   The class type_info holds implementation-specific information about a type,
   including the name of the type and means to compare two types for equality or
   collating order. This is the class returned by the typeid operator.

   The type_info class is neither CopyConstructible nor CopyAssignable.
