.SH NAME
std::feholdexcept \- std::feholdexcept

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cfenv>
   int feholdexcept( std::fenv_t* envp )  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   First, saves the current floating-point environment to the object pointed to by envp
   (similar to std::fegetenv), then clears all floating-point status flags, and then
   installs the non-stop mode: future floating-point exceptions will not interrupt
   execution (will not trap), until the floating-point environment is restored by
   std::feupdateenv or std::fesetenv.

   This function may be used in the beginning of a subroutine that must hide the
   floating-point exceptions it may raise from the caller. If only some exceptions must
   be suppressed, while others must be reported, the non-stop mode is usually ended
   with a call to std::feupdateenv after clearing the unwanted exceptions.

.SH Parameters

   envp - pointer to the object of type std::fenv_t where the floating-point
          environment will be stored

.SH Return value

   0 on success, non-zero otherwise.
