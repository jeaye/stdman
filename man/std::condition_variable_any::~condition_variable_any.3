std::condition_variable_any::~condition_variable_any \- std::condition_variable_any::~condition_variable_any

.SH Synopsis
   ~condition_variable_any(); \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Destroys the object of type std::condition_variable_any

   It is only safe to invoke the destructor if all threads have been notified. It is
   not required that they have exited their respective wait functions: some threads may
   still be waiting to reacquire the associated lock, or may be waiting to be scheduled
   to run after reacquiring it.

   The programmer must ensure that no threads attempt to wait on *this once the
   destructor has been started, especially when the waiting threads are calling the
   wait functions in a loop or are using the overloads of the wait functions that take
   a predicate.
