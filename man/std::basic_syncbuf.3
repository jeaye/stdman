.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <syncstream>
   template<

       class CharT,
       class Traits = std::char_traits<CharT>,                         \fI(since C++20)\fP

   > class basic_syncbuf : public std::basic_streambuf<CharT, Traits>

   std::basic_syncbuf is a wrapper for a std::basic_streambuf (provided at construction
   time as a pointer). It accumulates output in its own internal buffer, and atomically
   transmits its entire contents to the wrapped buffer on destruction and when
   explicitly requested, so that they appear as a contiguous sequence of characters. It
   guarantees that there are no data races and no interleaving of characters sent to
   the wrapped buffer as long as all other outputs made to the same buffer are made
   through, possibly different, instances of std::basic_syncbuf.

   Typical implementation of std::basic_syncbuf holds a pointer to the wrapped
   std::basic_streambuf, a boolean flag indicating whether the buffer will transmit its
   contents to the wrapped buffer on sync (flush), a boolean flag indicating a pending
   flush when the policy is to not emit on sync, an internal buffer that uses Allocator
   (such as std::string), and a pointer to a mutex used to synchronize emit between
   multiple threads accessing the same wrapped stream buffer (these mutexes may be in a
   hash map with pointers to basic_streambuf objects used as keys).

   Like other streambuf classes, std::basic_syncbuf is normally only accessed through
   the corresponding stream, std::osyncstream, not directly.

   Two specializations for common character types are also defined:
