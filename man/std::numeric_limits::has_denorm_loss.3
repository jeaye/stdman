.SH NAME
std::numeric_limits::has_denorm_loss \- std::numeric_limits::has_denorm_loss

.SH Synopsis
   static const bool has_denorm_loss;      \fI(until C++11)\fP
   static constexpr bool has_denorm_loss;  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   The value of std::numeric_limits<T>::has_denorm_loss is true for all floating-point
   types T that detect loss of precision when creating a subnormal number as
   denormalization loss rather than as inexact result (see below).

.SH Notes

   Standard-compliant IEEE 754 floating-point implementations of subnormal numbers are
   required to detect the loss of accuracy associated with the creation of such number,
   if it occurs, and may do so in one of the two distinct ways:

   1) Denormalization loss: the delivered result differs from what would have been
   computed were exponent range unbounded.
   2) Inexact result: the delivered result differs from what would have been computed
   were both exponent range and precision unbounded.

   No implementation of denormalization loss mechanism exists (accuracy loss is
   detected after rounding, as inexact result), and this option was removed in the 2008
   revision of IEEE Std 754.

   libstdc++, libc++, libCstd, and stlport4 define this constant as false for all
   floating-point types. Microsoft Visual Studio defines it as true for all
   floating-point types.

   As with any floating-point computations, accuracy loss may raise FE_INEXACT
