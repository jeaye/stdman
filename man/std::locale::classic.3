.SH NAME
std::locale::classic \- std::locale::classic

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <locale>
   static const locale& classic();

   Obtains a reference to the C++ locale that implements the classic "C" locale
   semantics. This locale, unlike the global locale, cannot be altered.

.SH Parameters

   none

.SH Return value

   Returns a reference to the "C" locale.

.SH Notes

   Some of the standard-required facets, such as the UTF-8/UTF-32 conversion facet
   std::codecvt<char32_t, char, std::mbstate_t>, have no equivalents in the "C" locale,
   but they are nevertheless present in the locale returned by std::locale::classic(),
   as in any other locale constructed in a C++ program.
