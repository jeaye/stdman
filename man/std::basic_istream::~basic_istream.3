.SH NAME
std::basic_istream::~basic_istream \- std::basic_istream::~basic_istream

.SH Synopsis
   virtual ~basic_istream();

   Destructs the input stream.

.SH Notes

   This destructor does not perform any operation on the underlying streambuffer
   (rdbuf()): the destructors of the derived input streams such as std::basic_ifstream
   and std::basic_istringstream are responsible for calling the destructors of the
   streambuffers.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <sstream>
 #include <iostream>

 void print_stringbuf(std::streambuf* p)
 {
     std::istream buf(p); // buf shares the buffer with s1
     int n;
     buf >> n;
     std::cout << n;
 } // calls the destructor of buf. p remains unaffected

 int main()
 {
     std::istringstream s1("10 20");
     print_stringbuf(s1.rdbuf());
     int n;
     s1 >> n;
     std::cout << ',' << n << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 10,20
