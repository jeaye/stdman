std::condition_variable_any::wait \- std::condition_variable_any::wait

.SH Synopsis
   template< class Lock >                                           \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   void wait( Lock& lock );
   template< class Lock, class Predicate >                          \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   void wait( Lock& lock, Predicate pred );
   template< class Lock, class Predicate >                          \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++20)\fP
   bool wait( Lock& lock, std::stop_token stoken, Predicate pred );

   wait causes the current thread to block until the condition variable is notified or
   a spurious wakeup occurs. pred can be optionally provided to detect spurious wakeup.

   1) Atomically calls lock.unlock() and blocks on *this.
   The thread will be unblocked when notify_all() or notify_one() is executed. It may
   also be unblocked spuriously.
   When unblocked, calls lock.lock() (possibly blocking on the lock), then returns.
   2,3) Waiting for a specific condition to become true, can be used to ignore spurious
   awakenings.
   2) Equivalent to
   while (!pred())
       wait(lock);
   3) Registers *this for the duration of this call, to be notified if a stop request
   is made on stoken's associated stop-state; it is then equivalent to
   while (!stoken.stop_requested())
   {
       if (pred())
           return true;
       wait(lock);
   }
   return pred();
   If pred() is ill-formed, or
   the return value of pred() is not convertible to bool
   \fI(until C++20)\fP
   decltype(pred()) does not model boolean-testable
   \fI(since C++20)\fP, the program is ill-formed.

   Right after wait returns, lock is locked by the calling thread. If this
   postcondition cannot be satisfied^[1], calls std::terminate.

    1. ↑ This can happen if the re-locking of the mutex throws an exception.

.SH Parameters

   lock   - an lock which must be locked by the calling thread
   stoken - a stop token to register interruption for
   pred   - the predicate to check whether the waiting can be completed
.SH Type requirements
   -
   Lock must meet the requirements of BasicLockable.
   -
   Predicate must meet the requirements of FunctionObject.

.SH Return value

   1,2) \fI(none)\fP
   3) The latest result of pred() before returning to the caller.

.SH Exceptions

   1) Does not throw.
   2,3) Any exception thrown by pred.

.SH Notes

   The returned value of overload \fB(3)\fP indicates whether pred evaluated to true,
   regardless of whether there was a stop requested or not.

   The effects of notify_one()/notify_all() and each of the three atomic parts of
   wait()/wait_for()/wait_until() (unlock+wait, wakeup, and lock) take place in a
   single total order that can be viewed as modification order of an atomic variable:
   the order is specific to this individual condition variable. This makes it
   impossible for notify_one() to, for example, be delayed and unblock a thread that
   started waiting just after the call to notify_one() was made.

.SH Example



// Run this code

 #include <chrono>
 #include <condition_variable>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <thread>

 std::condition_variable_any cv;
 std::mutex cv_m; // This mutex is used for three purposes:
                  // 1) to synchronize accesses to i
                  // 2) to synchronize accesses to std::cerr
                  // 3) for the condition variable cv
 int i = 0;

 void waits()
 {
     std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lk(cv_m);
     std::cerr << "Waiting... \\n";
     cv.wait(lk, []{ return i == 1; });
     std::cerr << "...finished waiting. i == 1\\n";
 }

 void signals()
 {
     std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
     {
         std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lk(cv_m);
         std::cerr << "Notifying...\\n";
     }
     cv.notify_all();

     std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));

     {
         std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lk(cv_m);
         i = 1;
         std::cerr << "Notifying again...\\n";
     }
     cv.notify_all();
 }

 int main()
 {
     std::thread t1(waits), t2(waits), t3(waits), t4(signals);
     t1.join();
     t2.join();
     t3.join();
     t4.join();
 }

.SH Possible output:

 Waiting...
 Waiting...
 Waiting...
 Notifying...
 Notifying again...
 ...finished waiting. i == 1
 ...finished waiting. i == 1
 ...finished waiting. i == 1
