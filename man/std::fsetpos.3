.SH NAME
std::fsetpos \- std::fsetpos

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstdio>
   int fsetpos( std::FILE* stream, const std::fpos_t* pos );

   Sets the file position indicator and the multibyte parsing state (if any) for the C
   file stream stream according to the value pointed to by pos.

   Besides establishing new parse state and position, a call to this function undoes
   the effects of std::ungetc and clears the end-of-file state, if it is set.

   If a read or write error occurs, the error indicator (std::ferror)for the stream is
   set.

.SH Parameters

   stream - file stream to modify
   pos    - pointer to a fpos_t object obtained from std::fgetpos called on a stream
            associated with the same file

.SH Return value

   0 upon success, nonzero value otherwise. Also, sets errno on failure.

.SH Notes

   After seeking to a non-end position in a wide stream, the next call to any output
   function may render the remainder of the file undefined, e.g. by outputting a
   multibyte sequence of a different length.
