.SH NAME
std::experimental::ranges::Destructible \- std::experimental::ranges::Destructible

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/ranges/concepts>
   template < class T >                                                 (ranges TS)
   concept bool Destructible = std::is_nothrow_destructible<T>::value;

   The concept Destructible specifies the concept of all types whose instances can
   safely be destroyed at the end of their lifetime (including reference types).

   There need not be any subsumption relationship between Destructible<T> and
   std::is_nothrow_destructible<T>::value.

.SH Notes

   Unlike the Destructible named requirement in the main C++ standard, Destructible
   requires the destructor to be noexcept(true), not merely non-throwing when invoked,
   and allows reference types and array types.
