.SH Synopsis
   void deallocate(void* p,

                   std::size_t bytes,                                   \fI(since C++17)\fP

                   std::size_t alignment = alignof(std::max_align_t));

   Deallocates the storage pointed to by p. p shall have been returned by a prior call
   to allocate(bytes, alignment) on a memory_resource that compares equal to *this, and
   the storage it points to shall not yet have been deallocated.

   Equivalent to do_deallocate(p, bytes, alignment);.
