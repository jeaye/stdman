.SH NAME
std::basic_syncbuf::operator= \- std::basic_syncbuf::operator=

.SH Synopsis
   basic_syncbuf& operator=(basic_syncbuf&& other);

   First, calls emit() to transmit all pending output (and delayed flush, if any) to
   the wrapped stream.

   Then performs move-assignment by moving all contents from other, including the
   temporary storage, the wrapped stream pointer, policy, and all other state (such as
   the mutex pointer). After move, other is not associated with a stream, and
   other.get_wrapped()==nullptr. The put area member pointers of the base class
   std::basic_streambuf of other are guaranteed to be null. Destroying a moved-from
   other will not produce any output.

   If std::allocator_traits<Allocator>::propagate_on_container_move_assignment::value
   is false, then the allocator is unchanged. Otherwise, after move-assignment,
   get_allocator() equals other.get_allocator().

.SH Parameters

   other - another std::basic_syncbuf to move from
