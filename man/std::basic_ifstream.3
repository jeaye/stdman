.SH NAME
std::basic_ifstream \- std::basic_ifstream

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <fstream>
   template<

       class CharT,
       class Traits = std::char_traits<CharT>

   > class basic_ifstream : public std::basic_istream<CharT, Traits>

   The class template basic_ifstream implements high-level input operations on
   file-based streams. It interfaces a file-based streambuffer (std::basic_filebuf)
   with the high-level interface of (std::basic_istream).

   A typical implementation of std::basic_ifstream holds only one non-derived data
   member: an instance of std::basic_filebuf<CharT, Traits>.
