.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <chrono>
   class year_month_weekday;   \fI(since C++20)\fP

   The class year_month_weekday represents the n-th weekday of a specific year and
   month. It is a field-based time point, with a resolution of std::chrono::days.
   std::chrono::years- and std::chrono::months-oriented arithmetic are supported
   directly. An implicit conversion to and from std::chrono::sys_days allows
   std::chrono::days-oriented arithmetic to be performed efficiently.

   year_month_weekday is a TriviallyCopyable StandardLayoutType.
