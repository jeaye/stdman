std::atomic<T>::fetch_and \- std::atomic<T>::fetch_and

.SH Synopsis
   T fetch_and( T arg,
   std::memory_order order =                          \fI(since C++11)\fP
   std::memory_order_seq_cst ) noexcept;              (member only of atomic<Integral>
   T fetch_and( T arg,                                template specialization)
   std::memory_order order =
   std::memory_order_seq_cst ) volatile noexcept;

   Atomically replaces the current value with the result of bitwise AND of the value
   and arg. The operation is read-modify-write operation. Memory is affected according
   to the value of order.

.SH Parameters

   arg   - the other argument of bitwise AND
   order - memory order constraints to enforce

.SH Return value

   The value immediately preceding the effects of this function in the modification
   order of *this.

   atomic_fetch_and          replaces the atomic object with the result of bitwise AND
   atomic_fetch_and_explicit with a non-atomic argument and obtains the previous value
   \fI(C++11)\fP                   of the atomic
   \fI(C++11)\fP                   \fI(function template)\fP
