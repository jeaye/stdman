.SH NAME
std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator::allocate_bytes \- std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator::allocate_bytes

.SH Synopsis
   [[nodiscard]] void* allocate_bytes( std::size_t nbytes,
                                       std::size_t alignment =            \fI(since C++20)\fP
   alignof(std::max_align_t) );

   Allocates nbytes bytes of storage at specified alignment alignment using the
   underlying memory resource. Equivalent to return resource()->allocate(nbytes,
   alignment);

.SH Parameters

   nbytes    - the number of bytes to allocate
   alignment - the alignment to use

.SH Return value

   A pointer to the allocated storage.

.SH Notes

   This function was introduced for use with the fully-specialized allocator
   std::polymorphic_allocator<>, but it may be useful in any specialization.

   The return type is void* (rather than, e.g., std::byte*) to support conversion to an
   arbitrary pointer type U* by static_cast<U*>.

.SH Exceptions

   May throw any exceptions thrown by the call to resource()->allocate.
