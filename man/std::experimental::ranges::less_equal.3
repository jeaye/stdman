.SH NAME
std::experimental::ranges::less_equal \- std::experimental::ranges::less_equal

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/ranges/functional>
   template< class T = void >

   requires StrictTotallyOrdered<T> ||
   Same<T, void> ||                                                         (ranges TS)
   /* < on two const T lvalues invokes a built-in operator comparing
   pointers */

   struct less_equal;
   template <>                                                              (ranges TS)
   struct less_equal<void>;

   Function object for performing comparisons. The primary template invokes operator<
   on const lvalues of type T with the argument order inverted and then negates the
   result. The specialization less_equal<void> deduces the parameter types of the
   function call operator from the arguments (but not the return type).

   All specializations of less_equal are Semiregular.

.SH Member types

std::experimental::ranges::less_equal::operator()

   constexpr bool operator()(const T& x, const T&  \fB(1)\fP (member only of primary
   y) const;                                           less_equal<T> template)

   requires StrictTotallyOrderedWith<T, U> ||
   /* std::declval<T>() < std::declval<U>()        \fB(2)\fP (member only of less_equal<void>
   resolves to                                         specialization)
   a built-in operator comparing pointers */

   constexpr bool operator()(T&& t, U&& u) const;

   1) Compares x and y. Equivalent to return !ranges::less<>{}(y, x);
   2) Compares t and u. Equivalent to return !ranges::less<>{}(std::forward<U>(u),
   std::forward<T>(t));.

.SH Notes

   Unlike std::less_equal, ranges::less_equal requires all six comparison operators <,
   <=, >, >=, == and != to be valid (via the StrictTotallyOrdered and
   StrictTotallyOrderedWith constraints) and is entirely defined in terms of
   ranges::less. However, the implementation is free to use operator<= directly,
   because those concepts require the results of the comparison operators to be
   consistent.
