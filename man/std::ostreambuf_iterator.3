std::ostreambuf_iterator \- std::ostreambuf_iterator

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <iterator>
   template< class CharT, class Traits = std::char_traits<CharT> >

   class ostreambuf_iterator : public                                     \fI(until C++17)\fP
   std::iterator<std::output_iterator_tag,

   void, void, void, void>
   template< class CharT, class Traits = std::char_traits<CharT> >        \fI(since C++17)\fP
   class ostreambuf_iterator;

   std::ostreambuf_iterator is a single-pass OutputIterator that writes successive
   characters into the std::basic_streambuf object for which it was constructed. The
   actual write operation is performed when the iterator (whether dereferenced or not)
   is assigned to. Incrementing the std::ostreambuf_iterator is a no-op.

   In a typical implementation, the only data members of std::ostreambuf_iterator are a
   pointer to the associated std::basic_streambuf and a boolean flag indicating if the
   the end of file condition has been reached.

   destructor            destructs an ostreambuf_iterator
   (implicitly declared) \fI(public member function)\fP
   operator=             writes a character to the associated output sequence
                         \fI(public member function)\fP
   operator*             no-op

.SH Member types

   Member type       Definition
   value_type        void
   difference_type   void
   pointer           void
   reference         void
   iterator_category std::output_iterator_tag

   Note: before C++17, these member types are required to be obtained by inheriting
   from std::iterator<std::output_iterator_tag,void,void,void,void>.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <string>
 #include <algorithm>
 #include <iterator>
 #include <iostream>

 int main()
 {
     std::string s = "This is an example\\n";
     std::copy(s.begin(), s.end(), std::ostreambuf_iterator<char>(std::cout));
 }

.SH Output:

 This is an example
