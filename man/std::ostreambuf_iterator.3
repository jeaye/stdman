   class ostreambuf_iterator;

   std::ostreambuf_iterator is a single-pass LegacyOutputIterator that writes
   successive characters into the std::basic_streambuf object for which it was
   constructed. The actual write operation is performed when the iterator (whether
   dereferenced or not) is assigned to. Incrementing the std::ostreambuf_iterator is a
   no-op.

   In a typical implementation, the only data members of std::ostreambuf_iterator are a
   pointer to the associated std::basic_streambuf and a boolean flag indicating if the
   the end of file condition has been reached.

   Member types iterator_category, value_type, difference_type, pointer
   and reference are required to be obtained by inheriting from           \fI(until C++17)\fP
   std::iterator<std::output_iterator_tag, void, void, void, void>.
