   class ostreambuf_iterator;

   std::ostreambuf_iterator is a single-pass OutputIterator that writes successive
   characters into the std::basic_streambuf object for which it was constructed. The
   actual write operation is performed when the iterator (whether dereferenced or not)
   is assigned to. Incrementing the std::ostreambuf_iterator is a no-op.

   In a typical implementation, the only data members of std::ostreambuf_iterator are a
   pointer to the associated std::basic_streambuf and a boolean flag indicating if the
   the end of file condition has been reached.

.SH Member types

   Member type       Definition

   difference_type   void
   pointer           void
   reference         void
   iterator_category std::output_iterator_tag

   These member types are required to be obtained by inheriting from             (until
   std::iterator<std::output_iterator_tag,void,void,void,void>.                  C++17)

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <string>
 #include <algorithm>
 #include <iterator>
 #include <iostream>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::string s = "This is an example\\n";
     std::copy(s.begin(), s.end(), std::ostreambuf_iterator<char>(std::cout));
 }

.SH Output:

 This is an example
