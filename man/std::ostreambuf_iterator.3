.TH std::ostreambuf_iterator 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <iterator>
   template< class CharT, class Traits = std::char_traits<CharT>>

   class ostreambuf_iterator : public std::iterator<std::output_iterator_tag,

   void, void, void, void>

   std::ostreambuf_iterator is a single-pass output iterator that writes successive
   characters into the std::basic_streambuf object for which it was constructed. The
   actual write operation is performed when the iterator (whether dereferenced or not)
   is assigned to. Incrementing the std::ostreambuf_iterator is a no-op.

   In a typical implementation, the only data members of std::ostreambuf_iterator are a
   pointer to the associated std::basic_streambuf and a boolean flag indicating if the
   the end of file condition has been reached.
