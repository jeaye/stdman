   }

   std::list is a container that supports constant time insertion and removal of
   elements from anywhere in the container. Fast random access is not supported. It is
   usually implemented as a doubly-linked list. Compared to std::forward_list this
   container provides bidirectional iteration capability while being less space
   efficient.

   Adding, removing and moving the elements within the list or across several lists
   does not invalidate the iterators or references. An iterator is invalidated only
   when the corresponding element is deleted.

   std::list meets the requirements of Container, AllocatorAwareContainer,
   SequenceContainer and ReversibleContainer.

.SH Template parameters

               The type of the elements.

               T must meet the requirements of CopyAssignable and         \fI(until C++11)\fP
               CopyConstructible.
               The requirements that are imposed on the elements depend
               on the actual operations performed on the container.       \fI(since C++11)\fP
               Generally, it is required that element type is a complete  \fI(until C++17)\fP
               type and meets the requirements of Erasable, but many
               member functions impose stricter requirements.
   T         - The requirements that are imposed on the elements depend
               on the actual operations performed on the container.
               Generally, it is required that element type meets the
               requirements of Erasable, but many member functions impose \fI(since C++17)\fP
               stricter requirements. This container (but not its
               members) can be instantiated with an incomplete element
               type if the allocator satisfies the allocator completeness
               requirements.

               
               An allocator that is used to acquire/release memory and to
   Allocator - construct/destroy the elements in that memory. The type must meet the
               requirements of Allocator. The behavior is undefined if
               Allocator::value_type is not the same as T.
