   std::list is a container that supports constant time insertion and removal of
   elements from anywhere in the container. Fast random access is not supported. It is
   usually implemented as a doubly-linked list. Compared to std::forward_list this
   container provides bidirectional iteration capability while being less space
   efficient.

   Adding, removing and moving the elements within the list or across several lists
   does not invalidate the iterators or references. An iterator is invalidated only
   when the corresponding element is deleted.

   std::list meets the requirements of Container, AllocatorAwareContainer,
   SequenceContainer and ReversibleContainer.

.SH Template parameters

               The type of the elements.

               T must meet the requirements of CopyAssignable and                (until
               CopyConstructible.                                                C++11)
               The requirements that are imposed on the elements depend on the   (since
               actual operations performed on the container. Generally, it is    C++11)
               required that element type is a complete type and meets the       (until
               requirements of Erasable, but many member functions impose        C++17)
   T         - stricter requirements.
               The requirements that are imposed on the elements depend on the

               required that element type meets the requirements of Erasable,
               but many member functions impose stricter requirements. This      (since
               container (but not its members) can be instantiated with an       C++17)
               incomplete element type if the allocator satisfies the allocator
               completeness requirements.

               Feature-test macro: __cpp_lib_incomplete_container_elements
               An allocator that is used to acquire/release memory and to
               construct/destroy the elements in that memory. The type must meet the
               requirements of Allocator.
   Allocator - The behavior is undefined

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <algorithm>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <list>

 int main()
 {
     // Create a list containing integers
     std::list<int> l = { 7, 5, 16, 8 };

     // Add an integer to the front of the list
     l.push_front(25);
     // Add an integer to the back of the list
     l.push_back(13);

     // Insert an integer before 16 by searching
     auto it = std::find(l.begin(), l.end(), 16);
     if (it != l.end()) {
         l.insert(it, 42);
     }

     // Print out the list
     std::cout << "l = { ";
     for (int n : l) {
