.SH NAME
std::basic_filebuf::close \- std::basic_filebuf::close

.SH Synopsis
   std::basic_filebuf<CharT, Traits>* close();

   If a put area exist (e.g. file was opened for writing), first calls
   overflow(Traits::eof()) to write all pending output to the file, including any
   unshift sequences.

   If the most recently called function, out of underflow(), overflow(), seekpos(), and
   seekoff(), was overflow(), then calls std::codecvt::unshift(), perhaps multiple
   times, to determine the unshift sequence according to the imbued locale, and writes
   that sequence to file with overflow(Traits::eof()).

   Then, closes the file as if by calling std::fclose(), regardless of whether any of
   the preceding calls succeeded or failed.

   If any of the function calls made, including the call to std::fclose(), fails,
   returns a null pointer. If any of the function calls made throws an exception, the
   exception is caught and rethrown after calling std::fclose(). If the file is already
   closed, returns a null pointer right away.

   In any case, updates the private member variable that is accessed by is_open().

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   this on success, a null pointer on failure.

.SH Notes

   close() is typically called through the destructor of std::basic_filebuf (which, in
   turn, is typically called by the destructor of std::basic_fstream.
