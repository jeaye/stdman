.TH std::aligned_union 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <type_traits>
   template< std::size_t Len, class... Types >  \fI(since C++11)\fP
   struct aligned_union;

   Provides the member typedef type, which is a POD type of a size and alignment
   suitable for use as uninitialized storage for an object of any of the types listed
   in Types. The size of the storage is at least Len. std::aligned_union also
   determines the strictest (largest) alignment requirement among all Types and makes
   it available as the constant alignment_value.
