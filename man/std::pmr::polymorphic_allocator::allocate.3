std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator::allocate \- std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator::allocate

.SH Synopsis
   T* allocate( std::size_t n );                \fI(since C++17)\fP
                                                \fI(until C++20)\fP
   [[nodiscard]] T* allocate( std::size_t n );  \fI(since C++20)\fP

   Allocates storage for n objects of type T using the underlying memory resource.
   Equivalent to return static_cast<T*>(resource()->allocate(n * sizeof(T),
   alignof(T)));.

.SH Parameters

   n - the number of objects to allocate storage for

.SH Return value

   A pointer to the allocated storage.

.SH Exceptions

   Throws std::length_error if n > SIZE_MAX / sizeof(T); may also any exceptions thrown
   by the call to resource()->allocate.
