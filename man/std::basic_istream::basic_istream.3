.SH NAME
std::basic_istream::basic_istream \- std::basic_istream::basic_istream

.SH Synopsis
   explicit basic_istream( std::basic_streambuf<CharT, Traits>* sb); \fB(1)\fP
   protected:                                                        \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   basic_istream( const basic_istream& rhs ) = delete;
   protected:                                                        \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   basic_istream( basic_istream&& rhs );

   1) Constructs the basic_istream object, assigning initial values to the base class
   by calling basic_ios::init(sb). The value of gcount() is initialized to zero.

   2) The copy constructor is protected, and is deleted. Input streams are not
   copyable.

   3) The move constructor copies the value of gcount() from rhs, sets the gcount()
   value of rhs to zero, and uses basic_ios<CharT, Traits>::move(rhs) to move all
   basic_ios members, except for the rdbuf(), from rhs into *this. This move
   constructor is protected: it is called by the move constructors of movable input
   stream classes std::basic_ifstream and std::basic_istringstream, which know how to
   correctly move the associated stream buffer.

.SH Parameters

   sb - streambuffer to use as underlying device

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <sstream>
 #include <iostream>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::istringstream s1("hello");
     std::istream s2(s1.rdbuf());                        // OK: s2 shares the buffer with s1
  
 //    std::istream s3(std::istringstream("test"));      // ERROR: move constructor is protected
 //    std::istream s4(s2);                              // ERROR: copy constructor is deleted
     std::istringstream s5(std::istringstream("world")); // OK: move ctor called by derived class
  
     std::cout << s2.rdbuf() << ' ' << s5.rdbuf() << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 hello world
