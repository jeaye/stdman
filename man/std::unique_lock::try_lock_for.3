.SH NAME
std::unique_lock::try_lock_for \- std::unique_lock::try_lock_for

.SH Synopsis
   template< class Rep, class Period >
   bool try_lock_for( const std::chrono::duration<Rep,Period>&            \fI(since C++11)\fP
   timeout_duration );

   Tries to lock the associated mutex. Blocks until specified timeout_duration has
   elapsed or the lock is acquired, whichever comes first. On successful lock
   acquisition returns true, otherwise returns false. Effectively calls
   mutex()->try_lock_for(timeout_duration).

   A steady clock is used to measure the duration. This function may block for longer
   than timeout_duration due to scheduling or resource contention delays.

   std::system_error is thrown if there is no associated mutex or if the mutex is
   already locked.

.SH Parameters

   timeout_duration - maximum duration to block for

.SH Return value

   true if the ownership of the mutex has been acquired successfully, false otherwise.

.SH Exceptions

     * Any exceptions thrown by mutex()->try_lock_for(timeout_duration)

     * If there is no associated mutex, std::system_error with an error code of
       std::errc::operation_not_permitted

     * If the mutex is already locked, std::system_error with an error code of
       std::errc::resource_deadlock_would_occur
