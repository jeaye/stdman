.TH std::clog,std::wclog 3 "2022.03.29" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::clog,std::wclog \- std::clog,std::wclog

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <iostream>
   extern std::ostream clog;    \fB(1)\fP
   extern std::wostream wclog;  \fB(2)\fP

   The global objects std::clog and std::wclog control output to a stream buffer of
   implementation-defined type (derived from std::streambuf), associated with the
   standard C output stream stderr, but, unlike std::cerr/std::wcerr, these streams are
   not automatically flushed and cout is not automatically tie()'d with these streams.

   These objects are guaranteed to be initialized during or before the first time an
   object of type std::ios_base::Init is constructed and are available for use in the
   constructors and destructors of static objects with ordered initialization (as long
   as <iostream> is included before the object is defined).

   Unless sync_with_stdio(false) has been issued, it is safe to concurrently access
   these objects from multiple threads for both formatted and unformatted output.

.SH Notes

   The 'c' in the name refers to "character" (stroustrup.com FAQ); clog means
   "character log" and wclog means "wide character log"

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <iostream>

 struct Foo {
     int n;
     Foo() {
        std::clog << "static constructor\\n";
     }
     ~Foo() {
        std::clog << "static destructor\\n";
     }
 };

 Foo f; // static object

 int main()
 {
     std::clog << "main function\\n";
 }

.SH Output:

 static constructor
 main function
 static destructor
