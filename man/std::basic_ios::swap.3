std::basic_ios::swap \- std::basic_ios::swap

.SH Synopsis
   protected:                      \fI(since C++11)\fP
   void swap( basic_ios& other );

   Exchanges the states of *this and other, except for the associated rdbuf objects.
   rdbuf() and other.rdbuf() returns the same values as before the call.

   This swap function is protected: it is called by the swap member functions of the
   derived stream classes such as std::basic_ofstream or std::basic_istringstream,
   which know how to correctly swap the associated streambuffers.
