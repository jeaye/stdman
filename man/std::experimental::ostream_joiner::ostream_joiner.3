std::experimental::ostream_joiner::ostream_joiner \- std::experimental::ostream_joiner::ostream_joiner

.SH Synopsis
   ostream_joiner( ostream_type& stream, const DelimT& \fB(1)\fP (library fundamentals TS v2)
   delimiter );
   ostream_joiner( ostream_type& stream, DelimT&&      \fB(2)\fP (library fundamentals TS v2)
   delimiter );
   ostream_joiner( const ostream_joiner& other ) =     \fB(3)\fP (library fundamentals TS v2)
   default;                                                (implicitly declared)
   ostream_joiner( ostream_joiner&& other ) = default; \fB(4)\fP (library fundamentals TS v2)
                                                           (implicitly declared)

   1) Constructs the iterator with the private ostream_type* member initialized with
   std::addressof(stream), the private delimiter member initialized with delimiter, and
   the private "first element" flag set to true.
   2) Constructs the iterator with the private ostream_type* member initialized with
   std::addressof(stream), the private delimiter member initialized with
   std::move(delimiter), and the private "first element" flag set to true.
   3,4) Implicitly declared copy/move constructor that copy/move constructs the private
   stream pointer, delimiter, and "first element" flag members.

.SH Parameters

   stream    - the output stream to be accessed by this iterator
   delimiter - the delimiter to be inserted into the stream in between two outputs
   other     - the ostream_joiner object from which this object is to be copy- or
               move-constructed
