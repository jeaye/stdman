   delimiter);                                                 v2)
                                                               (library fundamentals TS
   ostream_joiner(const ostream_joiner& other) = default;  \fB(3)\fP v2)
                                                               (implicitly declared)
                                                               (library fundamentals TS
   ostream_joiner(ostream_joiner&& other) = default;       \fB(4)\fP v2)
                                                               (implicitly declared)

   1) Constructs the iterator with the private ostream_type* member initialized with
   std::addressof(stream), the private delimiter member initialized with delimiter, and
   the private "first element" flag set to true.

   2) Constructs the iterator with the private ostream_type* member initialized with
   std::addressof(stream), the private delimiter member initialized with
   std::move(delimiter), and the private "first element" flag set to true.

   3-4) Implicitly declared copy/move constructor that copy/move constructs the private
   stream pointer, delimiter, and "first element" flag members.

.SH Parameters

   stream    - the output stream to be accessed by this iterator
   delimiter - the delimiter to be inserted into the stream in between two outputs
   other     - the ostream_joiner object from which this object is to be copy- or
               move-constructed
