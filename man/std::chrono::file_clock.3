.SH NAME
std::chrono::file_clock \- std::chrono::file_clock

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <chrono>
   class file_clock;           \fI(since C++20)\fP

   std::chrono::file_clock is the clock used for std::filesystem::file_time_type. Its
   epoch is unspecified.

   file_clock meets the TrivialClock requirements.

.SH Member types

   Member type Definition
   rep         signed arithmetic type representing the number of ticks in the clock's
               duration
   period      a std::ratio type representing the tick period of the clock, in seconds
   duration    std::chrono::duration<rep, period>, capable of representing negative
               durations
   time_point  std::chrono::time_point<std::chrono::file_clock>

.SH Member constants

                            true if the time between ticks is always constant, i.e.
   constexpr bool is_steady calls to now() return values that increase monotonically
   \fB[static]\fP                 even in case of some external clock adjustment, otherwise
                            false
                            \fI(public static member constant)\fP

.SH Member functions

   file_clock provides exactly one of the following two pairs of static member
   functions:

     * to_utc and from_utc; or
     * to_sys and from_sys.

   now                 returns a std::chrono::time_point representing the current point
   \fB[static]\fP            in time
                       \fI(public static member function)\fP 
   to_utc              converts between file_time and utc_time
   from_utc            \fI(public static member function)\fP 
   \fB[static]\fP (optional)
   to_sys              converts between file_time and sys_time
   from_sys            \fI(public static member function)\fP 
   \fB[static]\fP (optional)
