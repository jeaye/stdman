.TH std::type_info::name 3 "2024.06.10" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::type_info::name \- std::type_info::name

.SH Synopsis
   const char* name() const;           \fI(until C++11)\fP
   const char* name() const noexcept;  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Returns an implementation defined null-terminated character string containing the
   name of the type. No guarantees are given; in particular, the returned string can be
   identical for several types and change between invocations of the same program.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   Null-terminated character string containing the name of the type.

.SH Notes

   The lifetime of the array pointed to by the returned pointer is not specified, but
   in practice it persists as long as the RTTI data structure for the given type
   exists, which has application lifetime unless loaded from a dynamic library (that
   can be unloaded).

   Some implementations (such as MSVC, IBM, Oracle) produce a human-readable type name.
   Others, most notably gcc and clang, return the mangled name, which is specified by
   the Itanium C++ ABI. The mangled name can be converted to human-readable form using
   implementation-specific API such as abi::__cxa_demangle directly or through
   boost::core::demangle. It can also be piped through the command-line utility c++filt
   -t.

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <boost/core/demangle.hpp>
 #include <cstdlib>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <string>
 #include <typeinfo>

 struct Base { virtual ~Base() = default; };
 struct Derived : Base {};

 int main()
 {
     Base b1;
     Derived d1;

     const Base* pb = &b1;
     std::cout << typeid(*pb).name() << '\\n';
     pb = &d1;
     std::cout << typeid(*pb).name() << '\\n';

     std::string real_name = boost::core::demangle(typeid(pb).name());
     std::cout << typeid(pb).name() << " => " << real_name << '\\n';

     std::cout << "c++filt => " << std::flush;
     std::string s = typeid(pb).name();
     std::system(("c++filt -t " + s).data());
 }

.SH Possible output:

 // GCC/Clang:
 4Base
 7Derived
 PK4Base => Base const*
 c++filt => Base const*

 // MSVC:
 struct Base
 struct Derived
 struct Base const * __ptr64 => struct Base const * __ptr64
