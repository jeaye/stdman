.TH std::type_info::name 3 "2018.03.28" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::type_info::name \- std::type_info::name

.SH Synopsis
   const char* name() const;

   Returns an implementation defined null-terminated character string containing the
   name of the type. No guarantees are given, in particular, the returned string can be
   identical for several types and change between invocations of the same program.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   null-terminated character string containing the name of the type.

.SH Notes

   Some implementations (such as MSVC, IBM, Oracle) produce a human-readable type name.
   Others, most notably gcc and clang, return the mangled name. The mangled name can be
   converted to human-readable form using implementation-specific API such as
   abi::__cxa_demangle directly or through boost::core::demangle. Then can also be
   piped through the commandline utility c++filt -t.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <typeinfo>

 struct Base { virtual ~Base() = default; };
 struct Derived : Base {};

 int main() {
         Base b1;
         Derived d1;

         const Base *pb = &b1;
         std::cout << typeid(*pb).name() << '\\n';
         pb = &d1;
         std::cout << typeid(*pb).name() << '\\n';
 }

.SH Possible output:

 4Base
 7Derived
