.SH NAME
std::ranges::less_equal \- std::ranges::less_equal

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <functional>
   struct less_equal;              \fI(since C++20)\fP

   Function object for performing comparisons. Deduces the parameter types of the
   function call operator from the arguments (but not the return type).

.SH Member functions

   operator() checks if the first argument is less than or equal to the second
              \fI(public member function)\fP

std::ranges::less_equal::operator()

   template< class T, class U >
   constexpr bool operator()( T&& t, U&& u ) const;

   Equivalent to return !ranges::less{}(std::forward<U>(u), std::forward<T>(t));.

   This overload participates in overload resolution only if
   std::totally_ordered_with<T, U> is satisfied.

.SH Notes

   Unlike std::less_equal, std::ranges::less_equal requires all six comparison
   operators <, <=, >, >=, == and != to be valid (via the totally_ordered_with
   constraint) and is entirely defined in terms of std::ranges::less.
