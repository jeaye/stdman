.SH NAME
std::experimental::basic_string_view::find_last_of \- std::experimental::basic_string_view::find_last_of

.SH Synopsis
   constexpr size_type find_last_of(basic_string_view v,      \fB(1)\fP (library fundamentals
   size_type pos = npos) const noexcept;                          TS)
   constexpr size_type find_last_of(CharT c, size_type pos =  \fB(2)\fP (library fundamentals
   npos) const noexcept;                                          TS)
   constexpr size_type find_last_of(const CharT* s, size_type \fB(3)\fP (library fundamentals
   pos, size_type count) const;                                   TS)
   constexpr size_type find_last_of(const CharT* s, size_type \fB(4)\fP (library fundamentals
   pos = npos) const;                                             TS)

   Finds the last character equal to any of the characters in the given character
   sequence.

   1) Finds the last occurence of any of the characters of v in this view, starting at
   position pos.
   2) Equivalent to find_last_of(basic_string_view(&c, 1), pos).
   3) Equivalent to find_last_of(basic_string_view(s, count), pos).
   4) Equivalent to find_last_of(basic_string_view(s), pos).

.SH Parameters

   v     - view to search for
   pos   - position at which to start the search
   count - length of the string of characters to search for
   s     - pointer to a string of characters to search for
   ch    - character to search for

.SH Return value

   Position of the last occurrence of any character of the substring, or npos if no
   such character is found.

.SH Complexity

   O(size() * v.size()) at worst.
