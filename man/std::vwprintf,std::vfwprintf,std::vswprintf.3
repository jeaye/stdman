.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cwchar>
   int vwprintf( const wchar_t* format, va_list vlist );                     \fB(1)\fP
   int vfwprintf( std::FILE* stream, const wchar_t* format, va_list vlist ); \fB(2)\fP
   int vswprintf( const wchar_t* buffer, std::size_t buf_size,               \fB(3)\fP
                  const wchar_t* format, va_list vlist );

   Loads the data from locations, defined by vlist,, converts them to wide string
   equivalents and writes the results to a variety of sinks.

   1) Writes the results to stdout.
   2) Writes the results to a file stream stream.
   3) Writes the results to a wide string buffer. At most size-1 wide characters are
   written followed by null wide character.

.SH Parameters

stream   - output wide stream to write to
buffer   - pointer to a wide string to write to
buf_size - maximum number of wide characters to write
           pointer to a null-terminated wide string specifying how to interpret the data.

           The format string consists of ordinary wide characters (except %), which are copied unchanged into the output
           stream, and conversion specifications. Each conversion specification has the following format:

                 * introductory % character

                 * (optional) one or more flags that modify the behavior of the conversion:

                         * -: the result of the conversion is left-justified within the field (by default it is
                           right-justified)
                         * +: the sign of signed conversions is always prepended to the result of the conversion (by
                           default the result is preceded by minus only when it is negative)
                         * space: if the result of a signed conversion does not start with a sign character, or is
                           empty, space is prepended to the result. It is ignored if + flag is present.
                         * # : alternative form of the conversion is performed. See the table below for exact effects
                           otherwise the behavior is undefined.
                         * 0 : for integer and floating point number conversions, leading zeros are used to pad the
                           field instead of space characters. For integer numbers it is ignored if the precision is
                           explicitly specified. For other conversions using this flag results in undefined behavior. It
                           is ignored if - flag is present.

                 * (optional) integer value or * that specifies minimum field width. The result is padded with space
                   characters (by default), if required, on the left when right-justified, or on the right if
                   left-justified. In the case when * is used, the width is specified by an additional argument of type
                   int. If the value of the argument is negative, it results with the - flag specified and positive
                   field width. (Note: This is the minimum width: The value is never truncated.)

                 * (optional) . followed by integer number or *, or neither that specifies precision of the conversion.
                   In the case when * is used, the precision is specified by an additional argument of type int. If the
                   value of this argument is negative, it is ignored. If neither a number nor * is used, the precision
                   is taken as zero. See the table below for exact effects of precision.

                 * (optional) length modifier that specifies the size of the argument

                 * conversion format specifier

           The following format specifiers are available:

                      a pointer.

           The floating point conversion functions convert infinity to inf or infinity. Which one is used is
           implementation defined.

           Not-a-number is converted to nan or nan(char_sequence). Which one is used is implementation defined.

           The conversions F, E, G, A output INF, INFINITY, NAN instead.

           Even though %c expects int argument, it is safe to pass a char because of the integer promotion that takes
           place when a variadic function is called.

           The correct conversion specifications for the fixed-width character types (int8_t, etc) are defined in the
           header <cinttypes> (although PRIdMAX, PRIuMAX, etc is synonymous with %jd, %ju, etc).

           The memory-writing conversion specifier %n is a common target of security exploits where format strings
           depend on user input and is not supported by the bounds-checked printf_s family of functions.

           There is a sequence point after the action of each conversion specifier; this permits storing multiple %n
           results in the same variable or, as an edge case, printing a string modified by an earlier %n within the same
           call.

           If a conversion specification is invalid, the behavior is undefined.

.SH Return value

   1,2) Number of wide characters written if successful or negative value if an error
   occurred.
   3) Number of wide characters written (not counting the terminating null wide
   character) if successful or negative value if an encoding error occurred or if the
   number of characters to be generated was equal or greater than size.

.SH Notes

   While narrow strings provide std::vsnprintf, which makes it possible to determine
   the required output buffer size, there is no equivalent for wide strings, and in
   order to determine the buffer size, the program may need to call std::vswprintf,
   check the result value, and reallocate a larger buffer, trying again until
   successful.
