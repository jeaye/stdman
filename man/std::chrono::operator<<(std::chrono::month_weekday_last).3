std::chrono::operator<<(std::chrono::month_weekday_last) \- std::chrono::operator<<(std::chrono::month_weekday_last)

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <chrono>
   template <class CharT, class Traits>

   std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>&                  \fI(since C++20)\fP
   operator<<( std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& os,

   const std::chrono::month_weekday_last& mwdl );

   Outputs a textual representation of mwdl into os, as if by

   os << std::format(os.getloc(), STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{:L}/{:L}"),
   mwdl.month(), mwdl.weekday_last());

   where STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{:L}/{:L}") is "{:L}/{:L}" if CharT is char, and
   L"{:L}/{:L}" if CharT is wchar_t.

.SH Return value

   os.
