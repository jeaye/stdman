.TH std::multimap::swap 3 "Jun 28 2014" "2.0 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   void swap( multimap& other );

   Exchanges the contents of the container with those of other. Does not invoke any
   move, copy, or swap operations on individual elements.

   All iterators and references remain valid. The past-the-end iterator is invalidated.

   The Pred objects must be Swappable, and they are exchanged using unqualified call to
   non-member swap.
   If std::allocator_traits<allocator_type>::propagate_on_container_swap::value is
   true, then the allocators are exchanged using an unqualified call to non-member
   swap. Otherwise, they are not swapped (and if get_allocator() !=
   other.get_allocator(), the behavior is undefined).
