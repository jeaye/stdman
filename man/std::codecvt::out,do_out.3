std::codecvt::out,do_out \- std::codecvt::out,do_out

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <locale>
   public:

   result out( StateT& state,
   const InternT* from,
   const InternT* from_end,              \fB(1)\fP
   const InternT*& from_next,
   ExternT* to,
   ExternT* to_end,

   ExternT*& to_next ) const;
   protected:

   virtual result do_out( StateT& state,
   const InternT* from,
   const InternT* from_end,              \fB(2)\fP
   const InternT*& from_next,
   ExternT* to,
   ExternT* to_end,

   ExternT*& to_next ) const;

   1) public member function, calls the member function do_out of the most derived
   class.
   2) If this codecvt facet defines a conversion, translates the internal characters
   from the source range [from, from_end) to external characters, placing the results
   in the subsequent locations starting at to. Converts no more than from_end - from
   internal characters and writes no more than to_end - to external characters. Leaves
   from_next and to_next pointing one beyond the last element successfully converted.

   If this codecvt facet does not define a conversion, no characters are converted.
   to_next is set to be equal to to, state is unchanged, and std::codecvt_base::noconv
   is returned.

.SH Return value

   A value of type std::codecvt_base::result, indicating the success status as follows:

   ok      conversion completed
   partial not enough space in the output buffer or unexpected end of source buffer
   error   encountered a character that could not be converted
   noconv  this facet is non-converting, no output written

   The non-converting specialization std::codecvt<char, char, std::mbstate_t> always
   returns std::codecvt_base::noconv

.SH Notes

   Requires that from <= from_end && to <= to_end and that state either representing
   the initial shift state or obtained by converting the preceding characters in the
   sequence.

   While codecvt supports N:M conversions (e.g. UTF-16 to UTF-8, where two internal
   characters may be necessary to decide what external characters to output),
   std::basic_filebuf can only use codecvt facets that define a 1:N conversion, that is
   it must be able to process one internal character at a time when writing to a file.

   When performing N:M conversions, this function may return std::codecvt_base::partial
   after consuming all source characters (from_next == from_end). This means that
   another internal character is needed to complete the conversion (e.g. when
   converting UTF-16 to UTF-8, if the last character in the source buffer is a high
   surrogate).

   The effect on state is deliberately unspecified. In standard facets, it is used to
   maintain shift state like when calling std::wcsrtombs, and is therefore updated to
   reflect the shift state after the last successfully converted character, but a
   user-defined facet is free to use it to maintain any other state, e.g. count the
   number of special characters encountered.

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <string>
 #include <locale>

 int main()
 {
     std::locale::global(std::locale("en_US.utf8"));
     auto& f = std::use_facet<std::codecvt<wchar_t, char, std::mbstate_t>>(std::locale());
     std::wstring internal = L"z\\u00df\\u6c34\\U0001f34c"; // L"zß水🍌"

     // note that the following can be done with wstring_convert
     std::mbstate_t mb{}; // initial shift state
     std::string external(internal.size() * f.max_length(), '\\0');
     const wchar_t* from_next;
     char* to_next;
     f.out(mb, &internal[0], &internal[internal.size()], from_next,
               &external[0], &external[external.size()], to_next);
     // error checking skipped for brevity
     external.resize(to_next - &external[0]);

     std::cout << "The string in narrow multibyte encoding: " << external << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 The string in narrow multibyte encoding: zß水🍌
