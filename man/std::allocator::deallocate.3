.SH NAME
std::allocator::deallocate \- std::allocator::deallocate

.SH Synopsis
   void deallocate( T* p, std::size_t n );

   Deallocates the storage referenced by the pointer p, which must be a pointer
   obtained by an earlier call to allocate().

   The argument n must be equal to the first argument of the call to allocate() that
   originally produced p; otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

   Calls ::operator delete(void*), but it is unspecified when and how it is called.

.SH Parameters

   p - pointer obtained from allocate()
   n - number of objects earlier passed to allocate()

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP
