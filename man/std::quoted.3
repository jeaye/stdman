   /*unspecified*/ quoted( const CharT* s,                            \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++14)\fP

   template< class CharT, class Traits>

   /*unspecified*/ quoted( std::basic_string_view<CharT, Traits> s,   \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP

   CharT delim=CharT('"'), CharT escape=CharT('\\\\') );
   template< class CharT, class Traits, class Allocator >

   /*unspecified*/ quoted( std::basic_string<CharT, Traits,           \fB(4)\fP \fI(since C++14)\fP
   Allocator>& s,

   CharT delim=CharT('"'), CharT escape=CharT('\\\\') );

   Allows insertion and extraction of quoted strings, such as the ones found in CSV or
.SH XML.

   When used in an expression out << quoted(s, delim, escape), where out is an output
   stream with char_type equal to CharT and, for overloads 2-4, traits_type equal to
   Traits, behaves as a FormattedOutputFunction, which inserts into out a sequence of
   characters seq constructed as follows:

   a) First, the character delim is added to the sequence
   b) Then every character from s, except if the next character to output equals delim
   or equals escape (as determined by the stream's traits_type::eq), then first appends
   an extra copy of escape
   c) In the end, delim is appended to seq once more

   Then, if seq.size() < out.width(), adds out.width()-seq.size() copies of the fill
   character out.fill() either at the end of the sequence (if ios_base::left is set in
   out.flags()) or at the beginning of the sequence (in all other cases).

   Finally, outputs each character from the resulting sequence as if by calling
   out.rdbuf()->sputn(seq, n), where n=std::max(out.width(), seq.size()) and
   out.width\fB(0)\fP to cancel the effects of std::setw, if any.

   4) When used in an expression in >> quoted(s, delim, escape), where in is an input
   stream with char_type equal to CharT and traits_type equal to Traits, extracts
   characters from in, using std::basic_istream::operator>>, according to the following
   rules:
   a) If the first character extracted does not equal delim (as determined by the
   stream's traits_type::eq), then simply performs in >> s.
   b) Otherwise (if the first character is the delimiter):
   1) Turns off the skipws flag on the input stream
   2) Empties the destination string by calling s.clear()
   3) Extracts characters from in and appends them to s, except that whenever an escape
   character is extracted, it is ignored and the next character is appended to s.
   Extraction stops when !in == true or when an unescaped delim character is found.
   4) Discards the final (unescaped) delim character.
   5) Restores the skipws flag on the input stream to its original value.

.SH Parameters

   s      - the string to insert or extract
   delim  - the character to use as the delimiter, defaults to "
   escape - the character to use as the escape character, defaults to \\

.SH Return value

   Returns an object of unspecified type such that the described behavior takes place.

.SH Exceptions

   Throws std::ios_base::failure if operator>> or operator<< throws.

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <iomanip>
 #include <sstream>

 void default_delimiter() {
   const std::string in = "std::quoted() quotes this string and embedded \\"quotes\\" too";
   std::stringstream ss;
   ss << std::quoted(in);
   std::string out;
   ss >> std::quoted(out);

   std::cout << "Default delimiter case:\\n"
                "read in     [" << in << "]\\n"
                "stored as   [" << ss.str() << "]\\n"
                "written out [" << out << "]\\n\\n";
 }

 void custom_delimiter() {
   const char delim {'$'};
   const char escape {'%'};

   const std::string in = "std::quoted() quotes this string and embedded $quotes$ $too";
   std::stringstream ss;
   ss << std::quoted(in, delim, escape);
   std::string out;
   ss >> std::quoted(out, delim, escape);

   std::cout << "Custom delimiter case:\\n"
                "read in     [" << in << "]\\n"
                "stored as   [" << ss.str() << "]\\n"
                "written out [" << out << "]\\n\\n";
 }

 int main() {
   default_delimiter();
   custom_delimiter();
 }

.SH Output:

 Default delimiter case:
 read in     [std::quoted() quotes this string and embedded "quotes" too]
 stored as   ["std::quoted() quotes this string and embedded \\"quotes\\" too"]
 written out [std::quoted() quotes this string and embedded "quotes" too]

 Custom delimiter case:
 read in     [std::quoted() quotes this string and embedded $quotes$ $too]
 stored as   [$std::quoted() quotes this string and embedded %$quotes%$ %$too$]
 written out [std::quoted() quotes this string and embedded $quotes$ $too]
