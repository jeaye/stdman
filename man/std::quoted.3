   template< class CharT, class Traits, class Allocator >

   /*unspecified*/ quoted(std::basic_string<CharT, Traits,
   Allocator>& s,                                                     \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++14)\fP

                          CharT delim=CharT('"'), CharT
   escape=CharT('\\\\'));

   Allows insertion and extraction of quoted strings, such as the ones found in CSV or
.SH XML.

   1,2) When used in an expression out << quoted(s, delim, escape), where out is an
   output stream with char_type equal to CharT and, for overload 2, traits_type equal
   to Traits, behaves as a FormattedOutputFunction, which inserts into out a sequence
   of characters seq constructed as follows:
   a) First, the character delim is added to the sequence
   b) Then every character from s, except if the next character to output equals delim
   or equals escape (as determined by the stream's traits_type::eq), then first appends
   an extra copy of escape
   c) In the end, delim is appended to seq once more

   Then, if seq.size() < out.width(), adds out.width()-seq.size() copies of the fill
   character out.fill() either at the end of the sequence (if ios_base::left is set in
   out.flags()) or at the beginning of the sequence (in all other cases).
   Finally, outputs each character from the resulting sequence as if by calling
   out.rdbuf()->sputn(seq, n), where n=std::max(out.width(), seq.size()) and
   out.width\fB(0)\fP to cancel the effects of std::setw, if any.
   3) When used in an expression in >> quoted(s, delim, escape), where in is an input
   stream with char_type equal to CharT and traits_type equal to Traits, extracts
   characters from in, using std::basic_istream::operator>>, according to the following
   rules:
   a) If the first character extracted does not equal delim (as determined by the
   stream's traits_type::eq), then simply performs in >> s.
   b) Otherwise (if the first character is the delimiter):
   1) Turns off the skipws flag on the input stream
   2) Empties the destination string by calling s.clear()
   3) Extracts characters from in and appends them to s, except that whenever an escape
   character is extracted, it is ignored and the next character is appended to s.
   Extraction stops when !in==true or when an unescaped delim character is found.
   4) Discards the final (unescaped) delim character.
   5) Restores the skipws flag on the input stream to its original value.

.SH Parameters

   s      - the string to insert or extract
   delim  - the character to use as the delimiter, defaults to "
   escape - the character to use as the escape character, defaults to \\

.SH Return value

   Returns an object of unspecified type such that the described behavior takes place.

.SH Exceptions

   Throws std::ios_base::failure if operator>> or operator<< throws.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <iomanip>
 #include <sstream>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::stringstream ss;
     std::string in = "String with spaces, and embedded \\"quotes\\" too";
     std::string out;
  
     ss << std::quoted(in);
     std::cout << "read in     [" << in << "]\\n"
               << "stored as   [" << ss.str() << "]\\n";
  
     ss >> std::quoted(out);
     std::cout << "written out [" << out << "]\\n";
 }

.SH Output:

 read in     [String with spaces, and embedded "quotes" too]
 stored as   ["String with spaces, and embedded \\"quotes\\" too"]
 written out [String with spaces, and embedded "quotes" too]
