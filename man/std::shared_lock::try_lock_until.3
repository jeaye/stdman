.SH Synopsis
   template< class Clock, class Duration >
   bool try_lock_until( const std::chrono::time_point<Clock,Duration>&    \fI(since C++14)\fP
   timeout_time );

   Tries to lock the associated mutex in shared mode. Blocks until specified
   timeout_time has been reached or the lock is acquired, whichever comes first. On
   successful lock acquisition returns true, otherwise returns false. May block for
   longer than until timeout_time has been reached.

   Effectively calls mutex()->try_lock_shared_until(timeout_time)

   std::system_error is thrown if there is no associated mutex or if the mutex is
   already locked.
