.SH NAME
std::bitset::reference \- std::bitset::reference

.SH Synopsis
   class reference;

   The std::bitset class includes std::bitset::reference as a publicly-accessible
   nested class. This class is used as a proxy object to allow users to interact with
   individual bits of a bitset, since standard C++ types (like references and pointers)
   are not built with enough precision to specify individual bits.

   The primary use of std::bitset::reference is to provide an l-value that can be
   returned from operator[].

   Any reads or writes to a bitset that happen via a std::bitset::reference potentially
   read or write to the entire underlying bitset.

.SH Member functions

   constructor   constructs the reference. Accessible only to std::bitset itself
                 (private member function)
   destructor    ~reference
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
   operator=     assigns a bool to the referenced bit
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
   operator bool returns the referenced bit
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
   operator ~    returns inverted referenced bit
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
   flip          flips the referenced bit
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
