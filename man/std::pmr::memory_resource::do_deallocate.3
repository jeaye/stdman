std::pmr::memory_resource::do_deallocate \- std::pmr::memory_resource::do_deallocate

.SH Synopsis
   virtual void do_deallocate(void* p, std::size_t bytes, std::size_t     \fI(since C++17)\fP
   alignment) = 0;

   Deallocates the storage pointed to by p.

   p must have been returned by a prior call to allocate(bytes, alignment) on a
   memory_resource that compares equal to *this, and the storage it points to must not
   yet have been deallocated, otherwise the behavior is undefined.
