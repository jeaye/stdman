.SH NAME
std::sig_atomic_t \- std::sig_atomic_t

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <csignal>
   typedef /* unspecified */ sig_atomic_t;

   An integer type which can be accessed as an atomic entity even in the presence of
   asynchronous interrupts made by signals.

.SH Notes

   Until C++11, which introduced std::atomic and std::atomic_signal_fence, about the
   only thing a strictly conforming program could do in a signal handler was to assign
   a value to a volatile static std::sig_atomic_t variable and promptly return.
