.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <iterator>
   template< std::semiregular S >  \fI(since C++20)\fP
   class move_sentinel;

   std::move_sentinel is a sentinel adaptor used for denoting ranges together with
   std::move_iterator.

.SH Template parameters

   S - the type of underlying sentinel

.SH Member functions

   constructor   constructs a new move_sentinel
   (C++20)       \fI(public member function)\fP
   operator=     assigns the contents of one move_sentinel to another
   (C++20)       \fI(public member function)\fP
   base          return a copy of the underlying sentinel
   (C++20)       \fI(public member function)\fP

.SH Member objects

   Member name                  Definition
   last (private member object) underlying sentinel, the name is for exposition only

.SH Non-member functions

   Notes: These functions are hidden friends of std::move_iterator and invisible to
   ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup.

   operator==(std::move_sentinel) compares the underlying iterator and the underlying
   (C++20)                        sentinel
                                  \fI(function template)\fP
   operator-(std::move_sentinel)  computes the distance between the underlying iterator
   (C++20)                        and the underlying sentinel
                                  \fI(function template)\fP
