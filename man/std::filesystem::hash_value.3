.TH std::filesystem::hash_value 3 "2018.03.28" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::filesystem::hash_value \- std::filesystem::hash_value

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <filesystem>
   std::size_t hash_value( const path& p ) noexcept;  \fI(since C++17)\fP

.SH Parameters

   p - a std::filesystem::path object

.SH Return value

   A hash value such that if for two paths, p1 == p2 then hash_value(p1) ==
   hash_value(p2).

.SH Exceptions

   noexcept specification:
   noexcept

.SH Notes

   Equality of two paths is determined by comparing each component separately, so, for
   example "a//b" equals "a/b" and has the same hash_value

   hash_value originates from the boost.filesystem library where it was used for
   interoperability with boost.hash (which calls hash_value where available)
