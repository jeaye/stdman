.TH std::strftime 3 "2024.06.10" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::strftime \- std::strftime

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <ctime>
   std::size_t strftime( char* str, std::size_t count, const char* format, const
   std::tm* tp );

   Converts the date and time information from a given calendar time tp to a
   null-terminated multibyte character string str according to format string format. Up
   to count bytes are written.

.SH Parameters

   str    - pointer to the first element of the char array for output
   count  - maximum number of bytes to write
   format - pointer to a null-terminated multibyte character string specifying the
            format of conversion
   tp     - pointer to the object containing date and time information to be converted

   Format string

   The format string consists of zero or more conversion specifiers and ordinary
   characters (except %). All ordinary characters, including the terminating null
   character, are copied to the output string without modification. Each conversion
   specification begins with % character, optionally followed by E or O modifier
   (ignored if unsupported by the locale), followed by the character that determines
   the behavior of the specifier. The following format specifiers are available:

   Conversion                       Explanation                          Used fields
   specifier
       %      writes literal %. The full conversion specification
              must be %%.

   The number of bytes written into the character array pointed to by str not including
   the terminating '\\0' on success. If count was reached before the entire string could
   be stored, 0 is returned and the contents are indeterminate.
