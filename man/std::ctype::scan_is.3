.SH NAME
std::ctype::scan_is \- std::ctype::scan_is

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <locale>
   const char* scan_is( mask m, const char* beg, const char* end ) const; \fB(1)\fP

   Locates the first character in the character array [beg, end) that satisfies the
   classification mask m, that is, the first character c such that table()[(unsigned
   char) c] & m would return true.

   If (unsigned char)c >= std::ctype<char>::table_size, then an implementation-defined
   value is substituted instead of table()[(unsigned char)c], possibly different for
   different values of c.

.SH Parameters

   m   - mask to search for
   beg - pointer to the first character in an array of characters to search
   end - one past the end pointer for the array of characters to search

.SH Return value

   Pointer to the first character in [beg, end) that satisfies the mask, or end if no
   such character was found.

.SH Notes

   Unlike the primary template std::ctype, this specialization does not perform a
   virtual function call when classifying characters. To customize the behavior, a
   derived class may provide a non-default classification table to the base class
   constructor.

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <iterator>
 #include <locale>

 int main()
 {
     std::locale loc("");
     auto& f = std::use_facet<std::ctype<char>>(loc);

     // skip until the first letter
     char s1[] = "      \\t\\t\\n  Test";
     const char* p1 = f.scan_is(std::ctype_base::alpha, std::begin(s1), std::end(s1));
     std::cout << '\\'' << p1 << "'\\n";

     // skip until the first letter
     char s2[] = "123456789abcd";
     const char* p2 = f.scan_is(std::ctype_base::alpha, std::begin(s2), std::end(s2));
     std::cout << '\\'' << p2 << "'\\n";
 }

.SH Output:

 'Test'
 'abcd'
