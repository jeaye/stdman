.SH NAME
std::atan2 \- std::atan2

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cmath>
   float       atan2( float y, float x );             \fB(1)\fP
   double      atan2( double y, double x );           \fB(2)\fP
   long double atan2( long double y, long double x ); \fB(3)\fP
   Promoted    atan2( Arithmetic1 y, Arithmetic2 x ); \fB(4)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Computes the arc tangent of y/x using the signs of arguments to determine the
   correct quadrant.

   4) A set of overloads or a function template for all combinations of arguments of
   arithmetic type not covered by 1-3). If any argument has integral type, it is cast
   to double. If any argument is long double, then the return type Promoted is also
   long double, otherwise the return type is always double.

.SH Parameters

   x, y - values of floating-point or integral types

.SH Return value

   If no errors occur, the arc tangent of y/x (arctan(

   y
   x

   )) in the range [-π ; +π] radians, is returned.
   Y argument
.SH Return value
   math-atan2.png
   X argument

   If a domain error occurs, an implementation-defined value is returned (NaN where
   supported)

   If a range error occurs due to underflow, the correct result (after rounding) is
   returned.

.SH Error handling

   Errors are reported as specified in math_errhandling

   Domain error may occur if x and y are both zero.

   If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559),

     * If x and y are both zero, domain error does not occur
     * If x and y are both zero, range error does not occur either
     * If y is zero, pole error does not occur
     * If y is ±0 and x is negative or -0, ±π is returned
     * If y is ±0 and x is positive or +0, ±0 is returned
     * If y is ±∞ and x is finite, ±π/2 is returned
     * If y is ±∞ and x is -∞, ±3π/4 is returned
     * If y is ±∞ and x is +∞, ±π/4 is returned
     * If x is ±0 and y is negative, -π/2 is returned
     * If x is ±0 and y is positive, +π/2 is returned
     * If x is -∞ and y is finite and positive, +π is returned
     * If x is -∞ and y is finite and negative, -π is returned
     * If x is +∞ and y is finite and positive, +0 is returned
     * If x is +∞ and y is finite and negative, -0 is returned
     * If either x is NaN or y is NaN, NaN is returned

.SH Notes

   std::atan2(y, x) is equivalent to std::arg(std::complex<double>(x,y))

   POSIX specifies that in case of underflow, y/x is the value returned, and if that is
   not supported, and implementation-defined value no greater than DBL_MIN, FLT_MIN,
   and LDBL_MIN is returned.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <cmath>
  
 int main()
 {
     // normal usage: the signs of the two arguments determine the quadrant
     std::cout << "(+1,+1) cartesian is (" << hypot(1,1)
               << ',' << atan2(1,1) << ") polar\\n"  // atan2(1,1) = +pi/4, Quad I
               << "(+1,-1) cartesian is (" << hypot(1,-1)
               << ',' << atan2(1,-1) << ") polar\\n" // atan2(1, -1) = +3pi/4, Quad II
               << "(-1,-1) cartesian is (" << hypot(-1,-1)
               << ',' << atan2(-1,-1) << ") polar\\n" // atan2(-1,-1) = -3pi/4, Quad III
               << "(-1,+1) cartesian is (" << hypot(-1,1)
               << ',' << atan2(-1,1) << ") polar\\n"; // atan2(-1,-1) = -pi/4, Quad IV
     // special values
     std::cout << "atan2(0, 0) = " << atan2(0,0)
               << " atan2(0,-0) = " << atan2(0,-0.0) << '\\n'
               << "atan2(7, 0) = " << atan2(7,0)
               << " atan2(7,-0) = " << atan2(7,-0.0) << '\\n';
 }
