.SH NAME
std::chrono::tai_clock::to_utc \- std::chrono::tai_clock::to_utc

.SH Synopsis
   template <class Duration>

   static std::chrono::utc_time<std::common_type_t<Duration,              \fI(since C++20)\fP
   std::chrono::seconds>>

   to_utc(const std::chrono::tai_time<Duration>& t) noexcept;

   Converts the tai_time t to a utc_time representing the same point in time.

.SH Return value

   A std::chrono::utc_time representing the same point in time as t, computed as if by
   constructing a value of the return type from t.time_since_epoch() and subtracting
   378691210s. (378691210 is the number of seconds between the epochs of the two
   clocks: 1958-01-01 00:00:00 TAI and 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC.)
