.SH NAME
std::atomic_ref::notify_all \- std::atomic_ref::notify_all

.SH Synopsis
   void notify_all() const noexcept;          \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++20)\fP
   void notify_all() const volatile noexcept; \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++20)\fP

   Performs atomic notifying operations.

   Unblocks all threads blocked in atomic waiting operations (i.e. wait()) on *this, if
   there are any; otherwise does nothing.

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Notes

   This form of change-detection is often more efficient than simple polling or pure
   spinlocks.
