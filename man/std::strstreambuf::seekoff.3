.TH std::strstreambuf::seekoff 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   protected:

   virtual pos_type seekoff(off_type off,
   ios_base::seekdir way,

   ios_base::openmode which = ios_base::in | ios_base::out);

   Repositions std::basic_streambuf::gptr and/or std::basic_streambuf::pptr, if
   possible, to the position that corresponds to exactly off characters from beginning,
   end, or current position of the get and/or put area of the buffer.

     * If which includes ios_base::in and this buffer is open for reading, then
       repositions the read pointer std::basic_streambuf::gptr inside the get area as
       described below
     * If which includes ios_base::out and this buffer is open for writing, then
       repositions the write pointer std::basic_streambuf::pptr inside the put area as
       described below
     * If which includes both ios_base::in and ios_base::out and the buffer is open for
       both reading and writing, and when is either ios_base::beg or ios_base::end,
       then repositions both read and write pointers as described below.
     * Otherwise, this function fails.

   If the pointer (either gptr or pptr or both) is repositioned, it is done as follows:

   1) If the pointer to be repositioned is a null pointer and the new offset newoff
   would be non-zero, this function fails.
   2) The new pointer offset newoff of type off_type is determined
   a) if way == ios_base::beg, then newoff is zero
   b) if way == ios_base::cur, then newoff is the current position of the pointer
   (gptr()-eback() or pptr()-pbase())
   c) if way == ios_base::end, then newoff is the length of the entire initialized part
   of the buffer (if overallocation is used, the high watermark pointer minus the
   beginning pointer)
   3) If newoff + off is negative or out of bounds of the initialized part of the
   buffer, the function fails
   4) Otherwise, the pointer is assigned as if by gptr() = eback() + newoff + off or
   pptr() = pbase() + newoff + off

.SH Parameters

   off   - relative position to set the next pointer(s) to
           defines base position to apply the relative offset to. It can be one of the
           following constants:

   dir   - Constant Explanation
           beg      the beginning of a stream
           end      the ending of a stream
           cur      the current position of stream position indicator
           defines whether the input sequences, the output sequence, or both are
           affected. It can be one or a combination of the following constants:
   which -
           Constant Explanation
           in       affect the input sequence
           out      affect the output sequence

.SH Return value

   pos_type(newoff) on success, pos_type(off_type(-1)) on failure and if pos_type
   cannot represent the resulting stream position.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <strstream>

 int main()
 {
     char a[] = "123";
     std::strstream ss(a, sizeof a); // in/out
     std::cout << "put pos = " << ss.tellp()
               << " get pos = " << ss.tellg() << '\\n';

     // absolute positioning both pointers
     ss.rdbuf()->pubseekoff(1, std::ios_base::beg); // move both forward
     std::cout << "put pos = " << ss.tellp()
               << " get pos = " << ss.tellg() << '\\n';

     // try to move both pointers 1 forward from current position
     if(-1 == ss.rdbuf()->pubseekoff(1, std::ios_base::cur))
         std::cout << "moving both pointers from current position failed\\n";
     std::cout << "put pos = " << ss.tellp()
               << " get pos = " << ss.tellg() << '\\n';

     // move the write pointer 1 forward, but not the read pointer
     // can also be called as ss.seekp(1, std::ios_base::cur);
     ss.rdbuf()->pubseekoff(1, std::ios_base::cur, std::ios_base::out);
     std::cout << "put pos = " << ss.tellp()
               << " get pos = " << ss.tellg() << '\\n';

     ss << 'a'; // write at put position
     std::cout << "Wrote 'a' at put position, the buffer is now: '";
     std::cout.write(a, sizeof a);
     std::cout << "'\\n";
     char ch;
     ss >> ch;
     std::cout << "reading at get position gives '" << ch << "'\\n";
 }

.SH Output:

 put pos = 0 get pos = 0
 put pos = 1 get pos = 1
 moving both pointers from current position failed
 put pos = 1 get pos = 1
 put pos = 2 get pos = 1
 Wrote 'a' at put position, the buffer is now: '12a'
 reading at get position gives '2'
