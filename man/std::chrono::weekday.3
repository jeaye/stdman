   The class weekday represent a day of the week in the Gregorian calendar. Its normal
   range is [0, 6], for Sunday through Saturday, but it can hold any value in the range
   [0, 255]. Seven named constants are predefined in the std::chrono namespace for the
   seven days of the week.

   weekday is a TriviallyCopyable StandardLayoutType.
