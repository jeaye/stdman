.TH std::basic_stringbuf<CharT,Traits,Allocator>::seekpos 3 "2019.08.27" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::basic_stringbuf<CharT,Traits,Allocator>::seekpos \- std::basic_stringbuf<CharT,Traits,Allocator>::seekpos

.SH Synopsis
   protected:

   virtual pos_type seekpos(pos_type sp,

   std::ios_base::openmode which = std::ios_base::in | std::ios_base::out );

   Repositions std::basic_streambuf::gptr and/or std::basic_streambuf::pptr, if
   possible, to the position indicated by sp

   Effectively executes seekoff(off_type(sp), std::ios_base::beg, which)

.SH Parameters

   sp    - stream position, such as one obtained by seekoff() or seekpos()
           defines whether the input sequences, the output sequence, or both are
           affected. It can be one or a combination of the following constants:
   which -
           Constant Explanation
           in       affect the input sequence
           out      affect the output sequence

.SH Return value

   sp on success or pos_type(off_type(-1)) on failure.

.SH Notes

   seekpos() is called by std::basic_streambuf::pubseekpos(), which is called by the
   single-argument versions of std::basic_istream::seekg() and
   std::basic_ostream::seekp()

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <sstream>
 #include <iostream>

 struct mybuf : std::stringbuf
 {
     mybuf(const std::string& str) : std::stringbuf(str) {}
     pos_type seekpos(pos_type sp, std::ios_base::openmode which) {
          std::cout << "Before seekpos(" << sp << "), size of the get area is "
                    << egptr()-eback() << " with "
                    << egptr()-gptr() << " read positions available\\n";
          pos_type rc = std::stringbuf::seekpos(sp, which);
          std::cout << "seekpos() returns " << rc << ".\\nAfter the call, "
                    << "size of the get area is "
                    << egptr()-eback() << " with "
                    << egptr()-gptr() << " read positions available\\n";
         return rc;
     }
 };

 int main()
 {
     mybuf buf("12345");
     std::iostream stream(&buf);
     stream.seekg(2);
 }

.SH Output:

 Before seekpos\fB(2)\fP, size of the get area is 5 with 5 read positions available
 seekpos() returns 2.
 After the call, size of the get area is 5 with 3 read positions available
