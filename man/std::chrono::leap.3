.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <chrono>
   class leap;                 \fI(since C++20)\fP

   The class leap represents the date and time of a leap second insertion.

   Users cannot construct leap objects except by copying from existing leap objects.
   The library implementation creates leap objects when it initializes the time zone
   database and provides const access to these objects.

   leap has a defaulted copy constructor and a defaulted copy assignment operator.
