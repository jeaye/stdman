   Searches the range [first, last) for the first sequence of count identical elements,
   each equal to the given value.

   1) Elements are compared using operator==.
   3) Elements are compared using the given binary predicate p.
   2,4) Same as (1,3), but executed according to policy.
   These overloads participate in overload resolution only if

   std::is_execution_policy_v<std::decay_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true.        (until
                                                                             C++20)

.SH Parameters

   first, last - the range of elements to examine
   count       - the length of the sequence to search for
   value       - the value of the elements to search for
   policy      - the execution policy to use. See execution policy for details.
                 binary predicate which returns true if the elements should be treated
                 as equal.

                 The signature of the predicate function should be equivalent to the
                 following:

                  bool pred(const Type1 &a, const Type2 &b);

   p           - While the signature does not need to have const &, the function must
                 not modify the objects passed to it and must be able to accept all
                 values of type (possibly const) Type1 and Type2 regardless of value
                 category (thus, Type1 & is not allowed
                 , nor is Type1 unless for Type1 a move is equivalent to a copy
                 \fI(since C++11)\fP).
                 The type Type1 must be such that an object of type ForwardIt can be
                 dereferenced and then implicitly converted to Type1. The type Type2
                 must be such that an object of type T can be implicitly converted to
                 Type2.
.SH Type requirements
   -
   ForwardIt must meet the requirements of LegacyForwardIterator.
   -
   BinaryPred must meet the requirements of BinaryPredicate.
   -
   Size must be convertible to an integral type.

.SH Return value

   If count is positive, returns an iterator to the beginning of the first sequence
   found in the range [first, last). Each iterator it in the sequence should satisfy
   the following condition:

   1,2) *it == value is true.
   3,4) p(*it, value) != false is true.

   If no such sequence is found, last is returned.

   If count is zero or negative, first is returned.

.SH Complexity

   Given \\(\\scriptsize N\\)N as std::distance(first, last):

   1,2) At most \\(\\scriptsize N\\)N comparisons using operator==.
   3,4) At most \\(\\scriptsize N\\)N applications of the predicate p.

.SH Exceptions

   The overloads with a template parameter named ExecutionPolicy report errors as
   follows:

     * If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws an exception
       and ExecutionPolicy is one of the standard policies, std::terminate is called.
       For any other ExecutionPolicy, the behavior is implementation-defined.
     * If the algorithm fails to allocate memory, std::bad_alloc is thrown.

   Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to
   previously published C++ standards.

      DR    Applied to           Behavior as published              Correct behavior
                       T was required to be EqualityComparable,  removed the
   LWG 283  C++98      but                                       requirement
                       the value type of InputIt is not always T
                       the complexity upper limit was N·count,   the upper limit is 0
   LWG 426  C++98      it is negative if count is negative       if count is
                                                                 non-positive
                       if count > 0, the complexity upper limit  changed the upper
   LWG 714  C++98      was N·count, but in                       limit to N in this
                       the worst case the number of              case
                       comparisons/operations is always N
   LWG 2150 C++98      the condition of “sequence occurence” was corrected
                       incorrect
