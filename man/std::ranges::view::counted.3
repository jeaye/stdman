.SH NAME
std::ranges::view::counted \- std::ranges::view::counted

.SH Synopsis
   namespace view {

   inline constexpr /*unspecified*/ counted = /*unspecified*/;  \fI(since C++20)\fP

   }

   A counted view presents a View of the elements of the counted range [i, n) for some
   iterator i and non-negative integer n.

   A counted range [i, n) is the n elements starting with the element pointed to by i
   and up to but not including the element, if any, pointed to by the result of n
   applications of ++i.

   If n == 0, the counted range is valid and empty. Otherwise, the counted range is
   only valid if n is positive, i is dereferenceable, and [++i, --n) is a valid counted
   range.

   Formally, if E and F are expressions, and T is the type std::decay_t<decltype((E))>,
   then

   if T models Iterator and decltype((F)) models ConvertibleTo<iter_difference_t<T>>,

   if T models RandomAccessIterator, view::counted(E, F) is expression-equivalent to
   ranges::subrange{E, E + static_cast<std::iter_difference_t<T>>(F)}
   otherwise view::counted(E, F) is expression-equivalent to
   ranges::subrange{std::counted_iterator{E, F}, std::default_sentinel}
   otherwise, view::counted(E, F) is ill-formed.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <ranges>
 #include <iostream>

 int main()
 {
   int a[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
   for(int i : std::view::counted(a, 3))
     std::cout << i << ' ';
 }

.SH Output:

 1 2 3
