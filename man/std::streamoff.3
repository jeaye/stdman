.TH std::streamoff 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <ios>
   typedef /*unspecified*/ streamoff;

   The type std::streamoff is a signed integral type of sufficient size to represent
   the maximum possible file size supported by the operating system. Typically, this is
   a typedef to long long.

   It is used to represent offsets from stream positions (values of type std::fpos). A
   std::streamoff value of -1 is also used to represent error conditions by some of the
   I/O library functions.

  Relationship with std::fpos

     * the difference between two std::fpos objects is a value of type std::streamoff

     * a value of type std::streamoff may be added or subtracted from std::fpos
       yielding a different std::fpos.

     * a value of type std::fpos is implicitly convertible to std::streamoff (the
       conversion result is the offset from the beginning of the file).

     * a value of type std::fpos is constructible from a value of type std::streamoff
