                                                           |
   std::ios_base::out );
   basic_stringbuf( const basic_stringbuf& rhs ) = delete;            \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   basic_stringbuf( basic_stringbuf&& rhs );                          \fB(4)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   1) Constructs a std::basic_stringbuf object: initializes the base class by calling
   the default constructor of std::basic_streambuf, initializes the character sequence
   with an empty string, and sets the mode to which.
   2) Constructs a std::basic_stringbuf object by performing the same initialization as
   1), followed by initializing the associated character sequence as if by calling
   str(new_str).
   3) The copy constructor is deleted; std::basic_stringbuf is not CopyConstructible
   4) Move-constructs a std::basic_stringbuf object by moving all state from another
   std::basic_stringbuf object rhs, including the associated string, the open mode, the
   locale, and all other state. After the move, the six pointers of
   std::basic_streambuf in *this are guaranteed to be different from the corresponding
   pointers in the moved-from rhs unless null.

.SH Parameters

   new_str - a basic_string used to initialize the buffer
   rhs     - another basic_stringbuf
             specifies stream open mode. It is bitmask type, the following constants
             are defined:

             Constant Explanation
   mode    - app      seek to the end of stream before each write
             binary   open in binary mode
             in       open for reading
             out      open for writing
             trunc    discard the contents of the stream when opening
             ate      seek to the end of stream immediately after open

.SH Notes

   Typically called by the constructor of std::basic_stringstream.

   The level of support for the open modes other than std::ios_base::in and
   std::ios_base::out varies among implementations. C++11 explicitly specifies the
   support for std::ios_base::ate in str() and in this constructor, but
   std::ios_base::app, std::ios_base::trunc, and std::ios_base::binary have different
   effects on different implementations.

.SH Example

   Demonstrates calling the constructor of basic_stringbuf directly.

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <sstream>
  
 int main()
 {
     // default constructor (mode = in|out)
     std::stringbuf buf1;
     buf1.sputc('1');
     std::cout << &buf1 << '\\n';
  
     // string constructor in at-end mode \fI(C++11)\fP
     std::stringbuf buf2("test", std::ios_base::in
                               | std::ios_base::out
                               | std::ios_base::ate);
     buf2.sputc('1');
     std::cout << &buf2 << '\\n';
  
     // append mode test (results differ among compilers)
     std::stringbuf buf3("test", std::ios_base::in
                               | std::ios_base::out
                               | std::ios_base::app);
     buf3.sputc('1');
     buf3.pubseekpos(1);
     buf3.sputc('2');
     std::cout << &buf3 << '\\n';
 }
