.SH NAME
std::set_unexpected \- std::set_unexpected

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <exception>
   std::unexpected_handler set_unexpected(                        (deprecated in C++11)
   std::unexpected_handler f );                                   (removed in C++17)

   Makes f the new global std::unexpected_handler and returns the previously installed
   std::unexpected_handler.

   This function is thread-safe. Every call to std::set_unexpected
   synchronizes-with (see std::memory_order) the subsequent calls to      \fI(since C++11)\fP
   std::set_unexpected and std::get_unexpected

.SH Parameters

   f - pointer to function of type std::unexpected_handler, or null pointer

.SH Return value

   The previously-installed unexpected handler, or a null pointer value if none was
   installed.
