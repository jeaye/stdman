std::pmr::new_delete_resource \- std::pmr::new_delete_resource

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <memory_resource>
   std::pmr::memory_resource* new_delete_resource() noexcept;  \fI(since C++17)\fP

   Returns a pointer to a memory_resource that uses the global operator new and
   operator delete to allocate memory.

.SH Return value

   Returns a pointer p to a static storage duration object of a type derived from
   std::pmr::memory_resource, with the following properties:

     * its allocate() function uses ::operator new to allocate memory;
     * its deallocate() function uses ::operator delete to deallocate memory;
     * for any memory_resource r, p->is_equal(r) returns &r == p.

   The same value is returned every time this function is called.
