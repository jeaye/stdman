   void construct( std::pair<T1, T2>* p, std::pair<U, V>&& xy );

   Constructs an object in allocated, but not initialized storage pointed to by p using
   OuterAllocator and the provided constructor arguments. If the object is of type that
   itself uses allocators, or if it is std::pair, passes InnerAllocator down to the
   constructed object.

   First, retrieve the outermost allocator OUTERMOST by calling
   this->outer_allocator(), and then calling the outer_allocator() member function
   recursively on the result of this call until reaching an allocator that has no such
   member function.

   Define OUTERMOST_ALLOC_TRAITS(x) as
   std::allocator_traits<std::remove_reference_t<decltype(OUTERMOST(x))>>

   1) Creates an object of the given type T by means of uses-allocator construction at
   the uninitialized memory location indicated by p, using OUTERMOST as the allocator.
   After adjustment for uses-allocator convention expected by T's constructor, calls
   OUTERMOST_ALLOC_TRAITS(*this)::construct.

   This overload only participates in overload resolution if U is not a           (until
   specialization of std::pair.                                                   C++20)
   Equivalent to

   std::apply(
       [p,this](auto&&... newargs) {
           OUTERMOST_ALLOC_TRAITS(*this)::construct(
               OUTERMOST(*this), p, std::forward<decltype(newargs)>(newargs)...); (since
       },                                                                         C++20)
       std::uses_allocator_construction_args(
           inner_allocator(),
           std::forward<Args>(args)...
       )
   );

  2) First, if either T1 or T2 is allocator-aware, modifies the tuples x and y to
  include the appropriate inner allocator, resulting in the two new tuples xprime
  and yprime, according to the following three rules:
  2a) if T1 is not allocator-aware (std::uses_allocator<T1,
  inner_allocator_type>::value==false, then xprime is
  std::tuple<Args1&&...>(std::move(x)). (it is also required that
  std::is_constructible<T1, Args1...>::value==true)
  2b) if T1 is allocator-aware (std::uses_allocator<T1,
  inner_allocator_type>::value==true), and its constructor takes an allocator tag
  (std::is_constructible<T1, std::allocator_arg_t, inner_allocator_type&,
  Args1...>::value==true), then xprime is

  std::tuple_cat(std::tuple<std::allocator_arg_t, inner_allocator_type&>(
                      std::allocator_arg, inner_allocator()
                 ),
                 std::tuple<Args1&&...>(std::move(x)))

  2c) if T1 is allocator-aware (std::uses_allocator<T1,
  inner_allocator_type>::value==true), and its constructor takes the allocator as
  the last argument (std::is_constructible<T1, Args1...,
  inner_allocator_type&>::value==true), then xprime is
  std::tuple_cat(std::tuple<Args1&&...>(std::move(x)),
  std::tuple<inner_allocator_type&>(inner_allocator())).
  Same rules apply to T2 and the replacement of y with yprime
  Once xprime and yprime are constructed, constructs the pair p in allocated        (until
  storage by calling                                                                C++20)

  std::allocator_traits<O>::construct( OUTERMOST,
                                       p,
                                       std::piecewise_construct,
                                       std::move(xprime),
                                       std::move(yprime));

  3) Equivalent to construct(p, std::piecewise_construct, std::tuple<>(),
  std::tuple<>()), that is, passes the inner allocator on to the pair's member
  types if they accept them.
  4) Equivalent to

  construct(p, std::piecewise_construct, std::forward_as_tuple(std::forward<U>(x)),
                                         std::forward_as_tuple(std::forward<V>(y)))

  5) Equivalent to

  construct(p, std::piecewise_construct, std::forward_as_tuple(xy.first),
                                         std::forward_as_tuple(xy.second))

  6) Equivalent to

  construct(p, std::piecewise_construct,
               std::forward_as_tuple(std::forward<U>(xy.first)),
               std::forward_as_tuple(std::forward<V>(xy.second)))

.SH Parameters

   p       - pointer to allocated, but not initialized storage
   args... - the constructor arguments to pass to the constructor of T
   x       - the constructor arguments to pass to the constructor of T1
   y       - the constructor arguments to pass to the constructor of T2
   xy      - the pair whose two members are the constructor arguments for T1 and T2

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Notes

   This function is called (through std::allocator_traits) by any allocator-aware
   object, such as std::vector, that was given a std::scoped_allocator_adaptor as the
   allocator to use. Since inner_allocator is itself an instance of
   std::scoped_allocator_adaptor, this function will also be called when the
   allocator-aware objects constructed through this function start constructing their
   own members.
