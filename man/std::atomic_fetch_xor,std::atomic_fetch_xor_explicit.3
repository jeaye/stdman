std::atomic_fetch_xor,std::atomic_fetch_xor_explicit \- std::atomic_fetch_xor,std::atomic_fetch_xor_explicit

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <atomic>
   template< class T >

   T atomic_fetch_xor( std::atomic<T>* obj,

   typename std::atomic<T>::value_type arg )
   noexcept;
   template< class T >

   T atomic_fetch_xor( volatile std::atomic<T>*
   obj,

   typename std::atomic<T>::value_type arg )
   noexcept;
   template< class T >                            \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   T atomic_fetch_xor_explicit( std::atomic<T>*
   obj,
   typename std::atomic<T>::value_type arg,

   std::memory_order order) noexcept;                               \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   template< class T >

   T atomic_fetch_xor_explicit( volatile
   std::atomic<T>* obj,
   typename std::atomic<T>::value_type arg,

   std::memory_order order) noexcept;

   Atomically replaces the value pointed by obj with the result of bitwise XOR between
   the old value of obj and arg. Returns the value obj held previously.

   The operation is performed as if the following is executed:

   1) obj->fetch_xor(arg)
   2) obj->fetch_xor(arg, order)

   If std::atomic<T> has no fetch_xor member (this member is only provided for integral
   types), the program is ill-formed.

.SH Parameters

   obj   - pointer to the atomic object to modify
   arg   - the value to bitwise XOR to the value stored in the atomic object
   order - the memory synchronization ordering for this operation: all values are
           permitted.

.SH Return value

   The value immediately preceding the effects of this function in the modification
   order of *obj.

.SH Possible implementation

   template< class T >
   T atomic_fetch_xor( std::atomic<T>* obj, typename std::atomic<T>::value_type arg )
   {
       return obj->fetch_xor(arg);
   }
