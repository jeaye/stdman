.SH NAME
std::experimental::barrier::arrive_and_drop \- std::experimental::barrier::arrive_and_drop

.SH Synopsis
   void arrive_and_drop();  (concurrency TS)

   Arrive at the barrier's synchronization point and remove the current thread from the
   set of participating threads. It is unspecified whether this function blocks until
   the completion phase has ended.

   The behavior is undefined if the calling thread is not in the set of participating
   threads of this barrier.

   Calls to arrive_and_drop synchronizes with the start of the completion phase of the
   barrier. If the call blocks, then the completion of the completion phase
   synchronizes with the return from the call.

   Calls to arrive_and_drop and arrive_and_wait never introduce data races with
   themselves or each other.

.SH Exceptions

   Throws nothing.

.SH Notes

   If every participating thread calls arrive_and_drop(), the barrier can only be
   destroyed.

   After a thread calls arrive_and_drop() on a barrier, it is no longer a member of its
   set of participating threads and hence can no longer call either arrive_and_drop()
   or arrive_and_wait() on the same barrier.
