.TH std::piecewise_constant_distribution 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <random>
   template< class RealType = double >     \fI(since C++11)\fP
   class piecewise_constant_distribution;

   std::piecewise_constant_distribution produces random floating-point numbers, which
   are uniformly distributed within each of the several subintervals [b
   i, b
   i+1), each with its own weight w
   i. The set of interval boundaries and the set of weights are the parameters of this
   distribution.

   The probability density for any b
   i≤x<b
   i+1 is

   w
   k
   S (b
   i+1 - b
   i)

   . where S is the sum of all weights.
