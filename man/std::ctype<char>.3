.TH std::ctype<char> 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <locale>
   template<>
   class ctype<char>;

   This specialization of std::ctype encapsulates character classification features for
   type char. Unlike general-purpose std::ctype, which uses virtual functions, this
   specialization uses table lookup to classify characters (which is generally faster).

   The base class std::ctype<char> implements character classification equivalent to
   the minimal "C" locale. The classification rules can be extended or modified if
   constructed with a non-default classification table argument, if constructed as
   std::ctype_byname<char> or as a user-defined derived facet. All std::istream
   formatted input functions are required to use std::ctype<char> for character
   classing during input parsing.

.SH Example

   The following example demonstrates modification of ctype<char> to tokenize
   comma-separated values

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <vector>
 #include <locale>
 #include <sstream>

 // This ctype facet classifies commas and endlines as whitespace
 struct csv_whitespace : std::ctype<char> {
     static const mask* make_table()
     {
         // make a copy of the "C" locale table
         static std::vector<mask> v(classic_table(), classic_table() + table_size);
         v[','] |=  space;  // comma will be classified as whitespace
         v[' '] &= ~space;      // space will not be classified as whitespace
         return &v[0];
     }
     csv_whitespace(std::size_t refs = 0) : ctype(make_table(), false, refs) {}
 };

 int main()
 {
     std::string in = "Column 1,Column 2,Column 3\\n123,456,789";
     std::string token;

     std::cout << "default locale:\\n";
     std::istringstream s1(in);
     while(s1 >> token)
             std::cout << "  " << token << '\\n';

     std::cout << "locale with modified ctype:\\n";
     std::istringstream s2(in);
     s2.imbue(std::locale(s2.getloc(), new csv_whitespace));
     while(s2 >> token)
             std::cout << "  " << token<< '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 default locale:
   Column
   1,Column
   2,Column
   3
   123,456,789
 locale with modified ctype:
   Column 1
   Column 2
   Column 3
   123
   456
   789
