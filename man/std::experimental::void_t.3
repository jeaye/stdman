.SH NAME
std::experimental::void_t \- std::experimental::void_t

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/type_traits>
   template< class... >                          (library fundamentals TS v2)
   using void_t = void;

   A utility metafunction that maps a sequence of any types to the type void.

.SH Notes

   This utility metafunction is used in template metaprogramming to detect ill-formed
   types in SFINAE context. First voted into C++17 as std::void_t, it was later added
   as well to the library fundamentals TS as std::experimental::void_t, because it is a
   dependency of the detection idiom.
