.SH NAME
std::enable_shared_from_this \- std::enable_shared_from_this

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <memory>
   template< class T > class enable_shared_from_this;  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   std::enable_shared_from_this allows an object t that is currently managed by a
   std::shared_ptr named pt to safely generate additional std::shared_ptr instances
   pt1, pt2, ... that all share ownership of t with pt.

   Publicly inheriting from std::enable_shared_from_this<T> provides the type T with a
   member function shared_from_this. If an object t of type T is managed by a
   std::shared_ptr<T> named pt, then calling T::shared_from_this will return a new
   std::shared_ptr<T> that shares ownership of t with pt.

.SH Notes

   A common implementation for enable_shared_from_this is to hold a weak reference
   (such as std::weak_ptr) to this. The constructors of std::shared_ptr detect the
   presence of an
   unambiguous and accessible (ie. public inheritance is mandatory)
   \fI(since C++17)\fP enable_shared_from_this base and assign the newly created
   std::shared_ptr to the internally stored weak reference
   if not already owned by a live std::shared_ptr
   \fI(since C++17)\fP. Constructing a std::shared_ptr for an object that is already managed
   by another std::shared_ptr will not consult the internally stored weak reference and
   thus will lead to undefined behavior.

   It is permitted to call shared_from_this only on a previously shared object, i.e. on
   an object managed by std::shared_ptr<T>. Otherwise
   the behavior is undefined
   \fI(until C++17)\fP
   std::bad_weak_ptr is thrown (by the shared_ptr constructor from a
   default-constructed weak_this)
   \fI(since C++17)\fP.

   enable_shared_from_this provides the safe alternative to an expression like
   std::shared_ptr<T>(this), which is likely to result in this being destructed more
   than once by multiple owners that are unaware of each other (see example below)

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <memory>
 #include <iostream>

 struct Good: std::enable_shared_from_this<Good> // note: public inheritance
 {
     std::shared_ptr<Good> getptr() {
         return shared_from_this();
     }
 };

 struct Bad
 {
     std::shared_ptr<Bad> getptr() {
         return std::shared_ptr<Bad>(this);
     }
     ~Bad() { std::cout << "Bad::~Bad() called\\n"; }
 };

 int main()
 {
     // Good: the two shared_ptr's share the same object
     std::shared_ptr<Good> gp1 = std::make_shared<Good>();
     std::shared_ptr<Good> gp2 = gp1->getptr();
     std::cout << "gp2.use_count() = " << gp2.use_count() << '\\n';

     // Bad: shared_from_this is called without having std::shared_ptr owning the caller
     try {
         Good not_so_good;
         std::shared_ptr<Good> gp1 = not_so_good.getptr();
     } catch(std::bad_weak_ptr& e) {
         // undefined behavior \fI(until C++17)\fP and std::bad_weak_ptr thrown \fI(since C++17)\fP
         std::cout << e.what() << '\\n';
     }

     // Bad, each shared_ptr thinks it's the only owner of the object
     std::shared_ptr<Bad> bp1 = std::make_shared<Bad>();
     std::shared_ptr<Bad> bp2 = bp1->getptr();
     std::cout << "bp2.use_count() = " << bp2.use_count() << '\\n';
 } // UB: double-delete of Bad

.SH Possible output:

 gp2.use_count() = 2
 bad_weak_ptr
 bp2.use_count() = 1
 Bad::~Bad() called
 Bad::~Bad() called
