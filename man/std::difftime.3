.TH std::difftime 3 "2018.03.28" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::difftime \- std::difftime

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <ctime>
   double difftime( std::time_t time_end, std::time_t time_beg );

   Computes difference between two calendar times as std::time_t objects (time_end -
   time_beg) in seconds. If time_end refers to time point before time_beg then the
   result is negative.

.SH Parameters

   time_beg, time_end - times to compare

.SH Return value

   Difference between two times in seconds.

.SH Notes

   On POSIX systems, std::time_t is measured in seconds, and difftime is equivalent to
   arithmetic subtraction, but C and C++ allow fractional units for time_t.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <ctime>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::time_t start = std::time(nullptr);
     volatile double d;
  
     // some time-consuming operation
     for (int n=0; n<10000; ++n) {
         for (int m=0; m<100000; ++m) {
            d += d*n*m;
         }
     }
  
     std::cout << "Wall time passed: "
               << std::difftime(std::time(nullptr), start) << " s.\\n";
 }

.SH Output:

 Wall time passed: 7 s.
