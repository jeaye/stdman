.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstdio>
   int vprintf( const char* format, va_list vlist );                  \fB(1)\fP
   int vfprintf( std::FILE* stream, const char* format, va_list vlist \fB(2)\fP
   );
   int vsprintf( char* buffer, const char* format, va_list vlist );   \fB(3)\fP
   int vsnprintf( char* buffer, std::size_t buf_size, const char*     \fB(4)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   format, va_list vlist );

   Loads the data from the locations, defined by vlist, converts them to character
   string equivalents and writes the results to a variety of sinks.

   1) Writes the results to stdout.
   2) Writes the results to a file stream stream.
   3) Writes the results to a character string buffer.
   4) Writes the results to a character string buffer. At most buf_size characters are
   written. The resulting character string will be terminated with a null character,
   unless buf_size is zero. If buf_size is zero, nothing is written and buffer may be a
   null pointer, however the return value (number of bytes that would be written) is
   still calculated and returned.

.SH Parameters

stream   - output file stream to write to
buffer   - pointer to a character string to write to
buf_size - maximum number of characters to write
           pointer to a null-terminated character string specifying how to interpret the data.

           The format string consists of ordinary multibyte characters (except %), which are copied unchanged into the
           output stream, and conversion specifications. Each conversion specification has the following format:

             * introductory % character

             * (optional) one or more flags that modify the behavior of the conversion:

             * -: the result of the conversion is left-justified within the field (by default it is right-justified)
             * +: the sign of signed conversions is always prepended to the result of the conversion (by default the
               result is preceded by minus only when it is negative)
             * space: if the result of a signed conversion does not start with a sign character, or is empty, space is
               prepended to the result. It is ignored if + flag is present.
             * # : alternative form of the conversion is performed. See the table below for exact effects otherwise the
               behavior is undefined.
             * 0 : for integer and floating point number conversions, leading zeros are used to pad the field instead
               of space characters. For integer numbers it is ignored if the precision is explicitly specified. For
               other conversions using this flag results in undefined behavior. It is ignored if - flag is present.

             * (optional) integer value or * that specifies minimum field width. The result is padded with space
               characters (by default), if required, on the left when right-justified, or on the right if
               left-justified. In the case when * is used, the width is specified by an additional argument of type
               int. If the value of the argument is negative, it results with the - flag specified and positive field
               width. (Note: This is the minimum width: The value is never truncated.)

             * (optional) . followed by integer number or *, or neither that specifies precision of the conversion. In
               the case when * is used, the precision is specified by an additional argument of type int. If the value
               of this argument is negative, it is ignored. If neither a number nor * is used, the precision is taken
               as zero. See the table below for exact effects of precision.

             * (optional) length modifier that specifies the size of the argument

             * conversion format specifier

           The following format specifiers are available:

           The floating point conversion functions convert infinity to inf or infinity. Which one is used is
           implementation defined.

           Not-a-number is converted to nan or nan(char_sequence). Which one is used is implementation defined.

           The conversions F, E, G, A output INF, INFINITY, NAN instead.

           Even though %c expects int argument, it is safe to pass a char because of the integer promotion that takes
           place when a variadic function is called.

           The correct conversion specifications for the fixed-width character types (int8_t, etc) are defined in the
           header <cinttypes>(C++) or <inttypes.h> (C) (although PRIdMAX, PRIuMAX, etc is synonymous with %jd, %ju,
           etc).

           The memory-writing conversion specifier %n is a common target of security exploits where format strings
           depend on user input and is not supported by the bounds-checked printf_s family of functions.

.SH Return value

   1-3) Number of characters written if successful or negative value if an error
   occurred.
   4) Number of characters written if successful or negative value if an error
   occurred. If the resulting string gets truncated due to buf_size limit, function
   returns the total number of characters (not including the terminating null-byte)
   which would have been written, if the limit was not imposed.

.SH Notes

   All these functions invoke va_arg at least once, the value of arg is indeterminate
   after the return. These functions to not invoke va_end, and it must be done by the
   caller.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <vector>
