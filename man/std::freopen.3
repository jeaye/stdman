.TH std::freopen 3 "2018.03.28" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::freopen \- std::freopen

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstdio>
   std::FILE* freopen( const char* filename, const char* mode, std::FILE* stream );

   First, attempts to close the file associated with stream, ignoring any errors. Then,
   if filename is not null, attempts to open the file specified by filename using mode
   as if by fopen, and associates that file with the file stream pointed to by stream.
   If filename is a null pointer, then the function attempts to reopen the file that is
   already associated with stream (it is implementation defined which mode changes are
   allowed in this case)

.SH Parameters

   filename - file name to associate the file stream to
              null-terminated character string determining new file access mode

                           extended       read/write
              File access mode flag "b" can optionally be specified to open a file in
              binary mode. This flag has no effect on POSIX systems, but on Windows,
              for example, it disables special handling of '\\n' and '\\x1A'.
              On the append file access modes, data is written to the end of the file
              regardless of the current position of the file position indicator.
              File access mode flag "x" can optionally be appended to "w" or "w+"
              specifiers. This flag forces the function to fail if the file exists,
              instead of overwriting it. \fI(C++17)\fP
              The behavior is undefined if the mode is not one of the strings listed
              above. Some implementations define additional supported modes (e.g.
              Windows).
   stream   - the file stream to modify

.SH Return value

   stream on success, NULL on failure

.SH Notes

   freopen is the only way to change the narrow/wide orientation of a stream once it
   has been established by an I/O operation or by std::fwide.

.SH Example

   The following code redirects stdout to a file

   
// Run this code

 #include <cstdio>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::printf("stdout is printed to console\\n");
     if(std::freopen("redir.txt", "w", stdout)) {
         std::printf("stdout is redirected to a file\\n"); // this is written to redir.txt
         std::fclose(stdout);
     }
 }

.SH Output:

 stdout is printed to console
