.SH NAME
std::basic_streambuf::sputn,std::basic_streambuf::xsputn \- std::basic_streambuf::sputn,std::basic_streambuf::xsputn

.SH Synopsis
   std::streamsize sputn( const char_type* s, std::streamsize count );          \fB(1)\fP
   protected:                                                                   \fB(2)\fP
   virtual std::streamsize xsputn( const char_type* s, std::streamsize count );

   1) Calls xsputn(s, count) of the most derived class.
   2) Writes count characters to the output sequence from the character array whose
   first element is pointed to by s. The characters are written as if by repeated calls
   to sputc(). Writing stops when either count characters are written or a call to
   sputc() would have returned Traits::eof().

   If the put area becomes full (pptr() == epptr()), it is unspecified whether
   overflow() is actually called or its effect is achieved by other means.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   The number of characters successfully written.

.SH Notes

   "achieved by other means" permits bulk I/O without intermediate buffering: that is
   how std::ofstream::write() simply passes the pointer to the suitable system call in
   some implementations.

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <sstream>

 int main()
 {
     std::ostringstream s1;
     std::streamsize sz = s1.rdbuf()->sputn("This is a test", 14);
     s1 << '\\n';
     std::cout << "The call to sputn() returned " << sz << '\\n'
               << "The output sequence contains " << s1.str();

     std::istringstream s2;
     sz = s2.rdbuf()->sputn("This is a test", 14);
     std::cout << "The call to sputn() on an input stream returned " << sz << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 The call to sputn() returned 14
 The output sequence contains This is a test
 The call to sputn() on an input stream returned 0

                      pptr() == epptr()                    be called
