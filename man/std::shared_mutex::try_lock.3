.SH NAME
std::shared_mutex::try_lock \- std::shared_mutex::try_lock

.SH Synopsis
   bool try_lock();  \fI(since C++17)\fP

   Tries to lock the mutex. Returns immediately. On successful lock acquisition returns
   true, otherwise returns false.

   This function is allowed to fail spuriously and return false even if the mutex is
   not currently locked by any other thread.

   If try_lock is called by a thread that already owns the mutex in any mode (shared or
   exclusive), the behavior is undefined.

   Prior unlock() operation on the same mutex synchronizes-with (as defined in
   std::memory_order) this operation if it returns true. Note that prior lock() does
   not synchronize with this operation if it returns false.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   true if the lock was acquired successfully, otherwise false.

.SH Exceptions

   Throws nothing.
