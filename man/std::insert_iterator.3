   class insert_iterator : public std::iterator< std::output_iterator_tag,

   std::insert_iterator is an OutputIterator that inserts elements into a container for
   which it was constructed, at the position pointed to by the supplied iterator. The
   container's insert() member function is called whenever the iterator (whether
   dereferenced or not) is assigned to. Incrementing the std::insert_iterator is a
   no-op.

   Member name           Definition
   container (protected) a pointer of type Container*
   iter (protected)      an iterator of type Container::iterator

.SH Member types

   difference_type   void
   pointer           void

   Note: before C++17, these member types are required to be obtained by inheriting
   from std::iterator<std::output_iterator_tag,void,void,void,void>.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <vector>
 #include <list>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <iterator>
 #include <algorithm>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::vector<int> v{1,2,3,4,5};
     std::list<int> l{-1,-2,-3};
     std::copy(v.begin(), v.end(), // may be simplified with std::inserter
               std::insert_iterator<std::list<int>>(l, std::next(l.begin())));
     for (int n : l)
         std::cout << n << ' ';
     std::cout << '\\n';
 }
