   Unordered multimap is an unordered associative container that supports equivalent
   keys (an unordered_multimap may contain multiple copies of each key value) and that
   associates values of another type with the keys. The unordered_multimap class
   supports forward iterators. Search, insertion, and removal have average
   constant-time complexity.

   Internally, the elements are not sorted in any particular order, but organized into
   buckets. Which bucket an element is placed into depends entirely on the hash of its
   key. This allows fast access to individual elements, since once the hash is
   computed, it refers to the exact bucket the element is placed into.

   The iteration order of this container is not required to be stable (so, for example,
   std::equal cannot be used to compare two std::unordered_multimaps), except that
   every group of elements whose keys compare equivalent (compare equal with key_eq()
   as the comparator) forms a contiguous subrange in the iteration order, also
   accessible with equal_range().

   std::unordered_multimap meets the requirements of Container,
   AllocatorAwareContainer, UnorderedAssociativeContainer.
