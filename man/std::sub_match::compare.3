.SH NAME
std::sub_match::compare \- std::sub_match::compare

.SH Synopsis
   int compare( const sub_match& m ) const;   \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   int compare( const string_type& s ) const; \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   int compare( const value_type* c ) const;  \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   1) Compares two sub_match directly by comparing their underlying character
   sequences. Equivalent to str().compare(m.str())
   2) Compares a sub_match with a std::basic_string. This function is implemented as
   follows. Equivalent to str().compare(s)
   3) Compares a sub_match with a null-terminated sequence of the underlying character
   type pointed to by s. Equivalent to str().compare(c)

   This function is infrequently used directly by application code. Instead, one of the
   non-member comparison operators are used.

.SH Parameters

   m - a pointer to another sub_match
   s - a pointer to a string to compare to
   c - a pointer to a null-terminated character sequence of the underlying value_type
       to compare to

.SH Return value

   A value less than zero if this sub_match is less than the other character sequence,
   zero if the both underlyinging character sequences are equal, greater than zero if
   this sub_match is greater than the other character sequence.
