.SH NAME
std::ranges::greater \- std::ranges::greater

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <functional>
   struct greater;                 \fI(since C++20)\fP

   Function object for performing comparisons. Deduces the parameter types of the
   function call operator from the arguments (but not the return type).

.SH Member types

   Member type    Definition
   is_transparent /* unspecified */

.SH Member functions

   operator() checks if the first argument is greater than the second
              \fI(public member function)\fP

std::ranges::greater::operator()

   template< class T, class U >

       requires StrictTotallyOrderedWith<T, U> ||
                /* std::declval<T>() < std::declval<U>() resolves to
                   a built-in operator comparing pointers */

   constexpr bool operator()(T&& t, U&& u) const;

   Compares t and u. Equivalent to return ranges::less{}(std::forward<U>(u),
   std::forward<T>(t));.

.SH Notes

   Unlike std::greater, std::ranges::greater requires all six comparison operators <,
   <=, >, >=, == and != to be valid (via the StrictTotallyOrderedWith constraint) and
   is entirely defined in terms of std::ranges::less. However, the implementation is
   free to use operator> directly, because those concepts require the results of the
   comparison operators to be consistent.
