.SH NAME
std::basic_streambuf::eback,gptr,egptr \- std::basic_streambuf::eback,gptr,egptr

.SH Synopsis
   char_type* eback() const; \fB(1)\fP
   char_type* gptr() const;  \fB(2)\fP
   char_type* egptr() const; \fB(3)\fP

   Returns pointers defining the get area.

   1) Returns the pointer to the beginning of the get area.

   2) Returns the pointer to the current character (get pointer) in the get area.

   3) Returns the pointer one past the end of the get area.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   1) The pointer to the beginning of the get area.

   2) The pointer to the current character (get pointer) in the get area.

   3) The pointer one past the end of the get area.

.SH Notes

   While the names "gptr" and "egptr" refer to the get area, the name "eback" refers to
   the end of the putback area: stepping backwards from gptr, characters can be put
   back until eback.
