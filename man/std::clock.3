.TH std::clock 3 "2018.03.28" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::clock \- std::clock

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <ctime>
   std::clock_t clock();

   Returns the approximate processor time used by the process since the beginning of an
   implementation-defined era related to the program's execution. To convert result
   value to seconds divide it by CLOCKS_PER_SEC.

   Only the difference between two values returned by different calls to std::clock is
   meaningful, as the beginning of the std::clock era does not have to coincide with
   the start of the program. std::clock time may advance faster or slower than the wall
   clock, depending on the execution resources given to the program by the operating
   system. For example, if the CPU is shared by other processes, std::clock time may
   advance slower than wall clock. On the other hand, if the current process is
   multithreaded and more than one execution core is available, std::clock time may
   advance faster than wall clock.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   Processor time used by the program so far or (clock_t)(-1) if that information is
   unavailable or its value cannot be represented.

.SH Exceptions

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Notes

   On POSIX-compatible systems, clock_gettime with clock id CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID
   offers better resolution.

   The value returned by clock() may wrap around on some implementations. For example,
   on a machine with 32-bit std::clock_t, it wraps after 2147 seconds or 36 minutes.

.SH Example

   This example demonstrates the difference between clock() time and real time

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <iomanip>
 #include <chrono>
 #include <ctime>
 #include <thread>
  
 // the function f() does some time-consuming work
 void f()
 {
     volatile double d = 0;
     for(int n=0; n<10000; ++n)
        for(int m=0; m<10000; ++m)
            d += d*n*m;
 }
  
 int main()
 {
     std::clock_t c_start = std::clock();
     auto t_start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
     std::thread t1(f);
     std::thread t2(f); // f() is called on two threads
     t1.join();
     t2.join();
     std::clock_t c_end = std::clock();
     auto t_end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
  
     std::cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(2) << "CPU time used: "
               << 1000.0 * (c_end-c_start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC << " ms\\n"
               << "Wall clock time passed: "
               << std::chrono::duration<double, std::milli>(t_end-t_start).count()
               << " ms\\n";
 }

.SH Output:

 CPU time used: 1590.00 ms
 Wall clock time passed: 808.23 ms
