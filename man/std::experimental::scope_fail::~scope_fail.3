.SH NAME
std::experimental::scope_fail::~scope_fail \- std::experimental::scope_fail::~scope_fail

.SH Synopsis
   ~scope_fail() noexcept;  (library fundamentals TS v3)

   Calls the exit function if the result of std::uncaught_exceptions() is greater than
   the counter of uncaught exceptions (typically on stack unwinding) and the scope_fail
   is active, then destroys the stored EF (if it is a function object) and any other
   non-static data members.

.SH Notes

   Whether the destructor is called on stack unwinding can be detected by the
   comparison of the result of std::uncaught_exceptions() and the counter of uncaught
   exceptions in the scope_fail.
