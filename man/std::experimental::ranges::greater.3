std::experimental::ranges::greater \- std::experimental::ranges::greater

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/ranges/functional>
   template< class T = void >

       requires StrictTotallyOrdered<T> ||
                Same<T, void> ||                                            (ranges TS)
                /* < on two const T lvalues invokes a built-in operator
   comparing pointers */

   struct greater;
   template <>                                                              (ranges TS)
   struct greater<void>;

   Function object for performing comparisons. The primary template invokes operator<
   on const lvalues of type T with the argument order inverted. The specialization
   greater<void> deduces the parameter types of the function call operator from the
   arguments (but not the return type).

   All specializations of greater are Semiregular.

.SH Member types

                   a built-in operator comparing
   pointers */

   constexpr bool operator()(T&& t, U&& u) const;

   1) Compares x and y. Equivalent to return ranges::less<>{}(y, x);
   2) Compares t and u. Equivalent to return ranges::less<>{}(std::forward<U>(u),
   std::forward<T>(t));.

.SH Notes

   Unlike std::greater, ranges::greater requires all six comparison operators <, <=, >,
   >=, == and != to be valid (via the StrictTotallyOrdered and StrictTotallyOrderedWith
   constraints) and is entirely defined in terms of ranges::less. However, the
   implementation is free to use operator> directly, because those concepts require the
   results of the comparison operators to be consistent.
