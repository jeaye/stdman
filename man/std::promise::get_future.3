.TH std::promise::get_future 3 "2024.06.10" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::promise::get_future \- std::promise::get_future

.SH Synopsis
   std::future<R> get_future();  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Returns a future object associated with the same shared state as *this.

   An exception is thrown if *this has no shared state or get_future has already been
   called. To get multiple "pop" ends of the promise-future communication channel, use
   std::future::share.

   Calls to this function do not introduce data races with calls to set_value,
   set_exception, set_value_at_thread_exit, or set_exception_at_thread_exit (therefore
   they need not synchronize with each other).

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   A future referring to the shared state of *this.

.SH Exceptions

   std::future_error on the following conditions:

     * *this has no shared state. The error code is set to no_state.
     * get_future() has already been called on a promise with the same shared state as
       *this. The error code is set to future_already_retrieved.
