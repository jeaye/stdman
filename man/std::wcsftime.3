.SH Parameters

   str    - pointer to the first element of the wchar_t array for output
   count  - maximum number of wide characters to write
            pointer to a null-terminated wide character string specifying the format of
            conversion.

            The format string consists of zero or more conversion specifiers and
            ordinary characters (except %). All ordinary characters, including the
            terminating null character, are copied to the output string without
            modification. Each conversion specification begins with % character,
            optionally followed by E or O modifier (ignored if unsupported by the
            locale), followed by the character that determines the behavior of the
            specifier. The following format specifiers are available:
