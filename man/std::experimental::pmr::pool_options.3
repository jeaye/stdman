.SH NAME
std::experimental::pmr::pool_options \- std::experimental::pmr::pool_options

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/memory_resource>
   struct pool_options {

   std::size_t max_blocks_per_chunk = 0;             (library fundamentals TS)
   std::size_t largest_required_pool_block = 0;

   };

   The struct std::experimental::pmr::pool_options contains a set of constructor
   options for std::experimental::pmr::synchronized_pool_resource and
   std::experimental::pmr::unsynchronized_pool_resource.

  Data members

                                           the maximum number of blocks that will be
   std::size_t max_blocks_per_chunk        allocated at once from the upstream memory
                                           resource to replenish a pool
                                           \fI(public member object)\fP
                                           the largest allocation size that is required
   std::size_t largest_required_pool_block to be fulfilled through the pooling
                                           mechanism
                                           \fI(public member object)\fP

   If the value of max_blocks_per_chunk is zero or greater than an
   implementation-defined limit, that limit is used instead. The implementation may use
   a smaller value than is specified and may use different values for different pools.

   If the value of largest_required_pool_block is zero or greater than an
   implementation-defined limit, that limit is used instead. The implementation may use
   a threshold greater than specified in this field.
