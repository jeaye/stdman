.SH NAME
std::ranges::take_while_view::take_while_view \- std::ranges::take_while_view::take_while_view

.SH Synopsis
   take_while_view() requires std::default_initializable<V> && \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++20)\fP
   std::default_initializable<Pred> = default;
   constexpr take_while_view( V base, Pred pred );             \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++20)\fP

   Constructs a take_while_view.

   1) Default constructor. Value-initializes the underlying view and the predicate.
   2) Move constructs the underlying view from base and the predicate from pred.

.SH Parameters

   base - underlying view
   fun  - predicate
