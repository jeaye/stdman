.TH std::experimental::filesystem::u8path 3 "Sep  4 2015" "2.0 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/filesystem>
   template< class Source >                    \fB(1)\fP (filesystem TS)
   path u8path( const Source& source );
   template< class InputIt >                   \fB(2)\fP (filesystem TS)
   path u8path( InputIt first, InputIt last );

   Constructs a path p from a UTF-8 encoded sequence of chars, supplied either as an
   std::string, or as a null-terminated multibyte string, or as a [first, last)
   iterator pair.

     * If path::value_type is char and native encoding is UTF-8, constructs a path
       directly as if by path(source) or path(first, last). Note: this is the typical
       situation of a POSIX system that uses Unicode, such as Linux.
     * Otherwise, if path::value_type is wchar_t and native encoding is UTF-16 (this is
       the situation on Windows), or if path::value_type is char16_t (native encoding
       guaranteed UTF-16) or char32_t (native encoding guaranteed UTF-32), then first
       converts the UTF-8 character sequence to a temporary string tmp of type
       path::string_type and then the new path is constructed as if by path(tmp)
     * Otherwise (for non-UTF-8 narrow character encodings and for non-UTF-16 wchar_t),
       first converts the UTF-8 character sequence to a temporary UTF-32-encoded string
       tmp of type std::u32string, and then the new path is constructed as if by
       path(tmp) (this path is taken on a POSIX system with a non-Unicode multibyte or
       single-byte encoded filesystem)

.SH Parameters

                 an UTF-8 encoded std::string, pointer to a null-terminated multibyte
   source      - string, or an input iterator with char value type that points to a
                 null-terminated multibyte string
   first, last - pair of InputIterators that specify a UTF-8 encoded character sequence
.SH Type requirements
   -
   InputIt must meet the requirements of InputIterator.
   -
   The value type of InputIt must be char

.SH Return value

   The path constructed from the input string after conversion from UTF-8 to the
   filesystem's native character encoding.

.SH Exceptions

   May throw filesystem_error on underlying OS API errors or std::bad_alloc if memory
   allocation fails.

.SH Notes

   On systems where native path format differs from the generic path format (neither
   Windows nor POSIX systems are examples of such OSes), if the argument to this
   function is using generic format, it will be converted to native.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <cstdio>
 #include <clocale>
 #include <fstream>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <experimental/filesystem>
 namespace fs = std::experimental::filesystem;

 int main()
 {
     std::setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.utf8");
     std::locale::global(std::locale("en_US.utf8"));

     fs::path p = fs::u8path(u8"要らない.txt");

     // native string representation can be used with OS APIs
     std::ofstream(p) << "File contents"; // this uses operator string()
     if(std::FILE* f = std::fopen(p.c_str(), "r")) {
         int ch;
         while((ch=fgetc(f))!= EOF) putchar(ch);
         std::fclose(f);
     }

     // multibyte and wide representation can be used for output
     std::cout.imbue(std::locale());
     std::cout << "\\nFile name in narrow multibyte encoding: "
               << p.string() << '\\n';

     std::wcerr.imbue(std::locale());
     std::wcerr << "File name in wide encoding: "
                << p.wstring() << '\\n';

     fs::remove(p);
 }

.SH Output:

 File contents
 File name in narrow multibyte encoding: 要らない.txt
 File name in wide encoding: 要らない.txt
