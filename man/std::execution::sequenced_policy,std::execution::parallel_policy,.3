   1) The execution policy type used as a unique type to disambiguate parallel
   algorithm overloading and require that a parallel algorithm's execution may not be
   parallelized. The invocations of element access functions in parallel algorithms
   invoked with this policy (usually specified as std::execution::seq) are
   indeterminately sequenced in the calling thread.
   2) The execution policy type used as a unique type to disambiguate parallel
   algorithm overloading and indicate that a parallel algorithm's execution may be
   parallelized. The invocations of element access functions in parallel algorithms
   invoked with this policy (usually specified as std::execution::par) are permitted to
   execute in either the invoking thread or in a thread implicitly created by the
   library to support parallel algorithm execution. Any such invocations executing in
   the same thread are indeterminately sequenced with respect to each other.
   3) The execution policy type used as a unique type to disambiguate parallel
   algorithm overloading and indicate that a parallel algorithm's execution may be
   parallelized, vectorized, or migrated across threads (such as by a parent-stealing
   scheduler). The invocations of element access functions in parallel algorithms
   invoked with this policy are permitted to execute in an unordered fashion in
   unspecified threads, and unsequenced with respect to one another within each thread.
   4) The execution policy type used as a unique type to disambiguate parallel
   algorithm overloading and indicate that a parallel algorithm's execution may be
   vectorized, e.g., executed on a single thread using instructions that operate on
   multiple data items.

   During the execution of a parallel algorithm with any of these three execution
   policies, if the invocation of an element access function exits via an uncaught
   exception, std::terminate is called, but the implementations may define additional
   execution policies that handle exceptions differently.

.SH Notes

   When using parallel execution policy, it is the programmer's responsibility to avoid
   data races and deadlocks:

 int a[] = {0,1};
 std::vector<int> v;
 std::for_each(std::execution::par, std::begin(a), std::end(a), [&](int i) {
   v.push_back(i*2+1); // Error: data race
 });

 std::atomic<int> x{0};
 int a[] = {1,2};
 std::for_each(std::execution::par, std::begin(a), std::end(a), [&](int) {
   x.fetch_add(1, std::memory_order_relaxed);
   while (x.load(std::memory_order_relaxed) == 1) { } // Error: assumes execution order
 });

 int x = 0;
 std::mutex m;
 int a[] = {1,2};
 std::for_each(std::execution::par, std::begin(a), std::end(a), [&](int) {
   std::lock_guard<std::mutex> guard(m);
   ++x; // correct
 });

   Unsequenced execution policies are the only case where function calls are
   unsequenced with respect to each other, meaning they can be interleaved. In all
   other situations in C++, they are indeterminately-sequenced (cannot interleave).
   Because of that, users are not allowed to allocate or deallocate memory, acquire
   mutexes, use non-lockfree std::atomic specializations, or, in general, perform any
   vectorization-unsafe operations when using these policies (vectorization-unsafe
   functions are the ones that synchronize-with another function, e.g.
   std::mutex::unlock synchronizes-with the next std::mutex::lock)

 int x = 0;
 std::mutex m;
 int a[] = {1,2};
 std::for_each(std::execution::par_unseq, std::begin(a), std::end(a), [&](int) {
   std::lock_guard<std::mutex> guard(m); // Error: lock_guard constructor calls m.lock()
   ++x;
 });

   If the implementation cannot parallelize or vectorize (e.g. due to lack of
   resources), all standard execution policies can fall back to sequential execution.
