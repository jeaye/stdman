.SH NAME
std::partial_order \- std::partial_order

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <compare>
   template< class T >
   constexpr std::partial_ordering partial_order(const T& a, const T&     (since C++20)
   b);

   Compares two values using 3-way comparison and produces a result of type
   std::partial_ordering

   Specifically,

     * If the expression a <=> b is well-formed and its result is convertible to
       std::partial_ordering, returns that result.
     * Otherwise, if the expression a <=> b is well-formed, but its result is not
       convertible to std::partial_ordering, then the function is defined as deleted.
     * Otherwise, if the expression a <=> b is ill-formed, but the expressions a == b
       and a < b are both well-formed and convertible to bool,

              * if a == b is true, returns std::partial_ordering::equivalent
              * otherwise, if a < b is true, returns std::partial_ordering::less
              * otherwise, returns std::partial_ordering::greater

     * Otherwise, the function is defined as deleted.

.SH Parameters

   a, b - values to compare

.SH Return value

   A value of type std::partial_ordering, as described above.
