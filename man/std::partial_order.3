.SH NAME
std::partial_order \- std::partial_order

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <compare>
   inline namespace /* unspecified */ {

   inline constexpr /* unspecified */ partial_order = /* unspecified */;  \fI(since C++20)\fP

   }
   Call signature
   template< class T, class U >

   requires /* see below */
   constexpr std::partial_ordering

   partial_order(T&& t, U&& u) noexcept(/* see below */);

   Compares two values using 3-way comparison and produces a result of type
   std::partial_ordering

   Let t and u be expressions and T and U denote decltype((t)) and decltype((u))
   respectively, std::partial_order(t, u) is expression-equivalent to:

     * If std::is_same_v<std::decay_t<T>, std::decay_t<U>> is true:

          * std::partial_ordering(partial_order(t, u)), if it is a well-formed
            expression with overload resolution performed in a context that does not
            include a declaration of std::partial_order,
          * otherwise, std::partial_ordering(std::compare_three_way()(t, u)), if it is
            well-formed,
          * otherwise, std::partial_ordering(std::weak_order(t, u)), if it is
            well-formed,

     * In all other cases, the expression is ill-formed, which can result in
       substitution failure when it appears in the immediate context of a template
       instantiation.

  Expression-equivalent

   Expression e is expression-equivalent to expression f, if

     * e and f have the same effects, and
     * either both are constant subexpressions or else neither is a constant
       subexpression, and
     * either both are potentially-throwing or else neither is potentially-throwing
       (i.e. noexcept(e) == noexcept(f)).

  Customization point objects

   The name std::partial_order denotes a customization point object, which is a const
   function object of a literal semiregular class type. For exposition purposes, the
   cv-unqualified version of its type is denoted as __partial_order_fn.

   All instances of __partial_order_fn are equal. The effects of invoking different
   instances of type __partial_order_fn on the same arguments are equivalent,
   regardless of whether the expression denoting the instance is an lvalue or rvalue,
   and is const-qualified or not (however, a volatile-qualified instance is not
   required to be invocable). Thus, std::partial_order can be copied freely and its
   copies can be used interchangeably.

   Given a set of types Args..., if std::declval<Args>()... meet the requirements for
   arguments to std::partial_order above, __partial_order_fn models

     * std::invocable<__partial_order_fn, Args...>,
     * std::invocable<const __partial_order_fn, Args...>,
     * std::invocable<__partial_order_fn&, Args...>, and
     * std::invocable<const __partial_order_fn&, Args...>.

   Otherwise, no function call operator of __partial_order_fn participates in overload
   resolution.
