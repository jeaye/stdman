.TH std::memset 3 "Apr  2 2017" "2.1 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::memset \- std::memset

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstring>
   void* memset( void* dest, int ch, std::size_t count );

   Converts the value ch to unsigned char and copies it into each of the first count
   characters of the object pointed to by dest. If the object is not trivially-copyable
   (e.g., scalar, array, or a C-compatible struct), the behavior is undefined. If count
   is greater than the size of the object pointed to by dest, the behavior is
   undefined.

.SH Parameters

   dest  - pointer to the object to fill
   ch    - fill byte
   count - number of bytes to fill

.SH Return value

   dest

.SH Notes

   std::memset may be optimized away (under the as-if rules) if the object modified by
   this function is not accessed again for the rest of its lifetime (e.g. gcc bug
   8537). For that reason, this function cannot be used to scrub memory (e.g. to fill
   an array that stored a password with zeroes). Solutions for that include C11
   memset_s, FreeBSD explicit_bzero or Microsoft SecureZeroMemory.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <cstring>

 int main()
 {
     int a[20];
     std::memset(a, 0, sizeof a);
     for (int ai : a) std::cout << ai;
 }

.SH Output:

 00000000000000000000
