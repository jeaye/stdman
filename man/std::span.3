.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <span>
   template<

       class T,                                  \fI(since C++20)\fP
       std::size_t Extent = std::dynamic_extent

   > class span;

   The class template span describes an object that can refer to a contiguous sequence
   of objects with the first element of the sequence at position zero. A span can
   either have a static extent, in which case the number of elements in the sequence is
   known and encoded in the type, or a dynamic extent.

   A typical implementation holds only two members: a pointer to T and a size.

.SH Template parameters

   T      - element type; must be a complete type that is not an abstract class type
   Extent - the number of elements in the sequence, or std::dynamic_extent if dynamic

                          implementation-defined LegacyRandomAccessIterator,
   iterator               ConstexprIterator, and LegacyContiguousIterator whose
                          value_type is value_type
                          implementation-defined constant LegacyRandomAccessIterator,
   const_iterator         ConstexprIterator, and LegacyContiguousIterator whose
                          value_type is value_type
   reverse_iterator       std::reverse_iterator<iterator>
   const_reverse_iterator std::reverse_iterator<const_iterator>

   Note: iterator is a mutable iterator if T is not const-qualified.

   All requirements on the iterator types of a Container applies to the iterator and
   const_iterator types of span as well.
