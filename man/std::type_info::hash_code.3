.TH std::type_info::hash_code 3 "2020.11.17" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::type_info::hash_code \- std::type_info::hash_code

.SH Synopsis
   size_t hash_code() const;  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Returns an unspecified value such that for all type_info objects referring to the
   same type, their hash_code() is the same.

   No other guarantees are given: type_info objects referring to different types may
   have the same hash_code (although the standard recommends that implementations avoid
   this as much as possible), and hash_code for the same type can change between
   invocations of the same program.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   A value that is identical for all type_info objects referring to the same type.

.SH Example

   The following program is an example of an efficient type-value mapping without using
   std::type_index.

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <typeinfo>
 #include <unordered_map>
 #include <string>
 #include <functional>
 #include <memory>
  
 struct A {
     virtual ~A() {}
 };
  
 struct B : A {};
 struct C : A {};
  
 using TypeInfoRef = std::reference_wrapper<const std::type_info>;
  
 struct Hasher {
     std::size_t operator()(TypeInfoRef code) const
     {
         return code.get().hash_code();
     }
 };
  
 struct EqualTo {
     bool operator()(TypeInfoRef lhs, TypeInfoRef rhs) const
     {
         return lhs.get() == rhs.get();
     }
 };
  
 int main()
 {
     std::unordered_map<TypeInfoRef, std::string, Hasher, EqualTo> type_names;
  
     type_names[typeid(int)] = "int";
     type_names[typeid(double)] = "double";
     type_names[typeid(A)] = "A";
     type_names[typeid(B)] = "B";
     type_names[typeid(C)] = "C";
  
     int i;
     double d;
     A a;
  
     // note that we're storing pointer to type A
     std::unique_ptr<A> b(new B);
     std::unique_ptr<A> c(new C);
  
     std::cout << "i is " << type_names[typeid(i)] << '\\n';
     std::cout << "d is " << type_names[typeid(d)] << '\\n';
     std::cout << "a is " << type_names[typeid(a)] << '\\n';
     std::cout << "b is " << type_names[typeid(*b)] << '\\n';
     std::cout << "c is " << type_names[typeid(*c)] << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 i is int
 d is double
 a is A
 b is B
 c is C
