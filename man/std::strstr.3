.SH NAME
std::strstr \- std::strstr

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstring>
   const char* strstr( const char* str, const char* target );
       char* strstr(       char* str, const char* target );

   Finds the first occurrence of the byte string target in the byte string pointed to
   by str. The terminating null characters are not compared.

.SH Parameters

   str    - pointer to the null-terminated byte string to examine
   target - pointer to the null-terminated byte string to search for

.SH Return value

   Pointer to the first character of the found substring in str, or NULL if no such
   character is found. If target points to an empty string, str is returned.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <cstring>
  
 int main()
 {
     const char *str = "Try not. Do, or do not. There is no try.";
     const char *target = "not";
     const char *result = str;
  
     while ((result = std::strstr(result, target)) != NULL) {
         std::cout << "Found '" << target
                   << "' starting at '" << result << "'\\n";
  
         // Increment result, otherwise we'll find target at the same location
         ++result;
     }
 }

.SH Output:

 Found 'not' starting at 'not. Do, or do not. There is no try.'
 Found 'not' starting at 'not. There is no try.'
