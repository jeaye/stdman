.SH NAME
std::logic_error \- std::logic_error

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <stdexcept>
   class logic_error;

   Defines a type of object to be thrown as exception. It reports errors that are a
   consequence of faulty logic within the program such as violating logical
   preconditions or class invariants and may be preventable.

   No standard library components throw this exception directly, but the exception
   types std::invalid_argument, std::domain_error, std::length_error,
   std::out_of_range, std::future_error, and std::experimental::bad_optional_access are
   derived from std::logic_error.

.SH Member functions

   constructor   constructs the exception object
                 \fI(public member function)\fP 

   

std::logic_error::logic_error

   explicit logic_error( const std::string& what_arg ); \fB(1)\fP
   explicit logic_error( const char* what_arg );        \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Constructs the exception object with what_arg as explanatory string that can be
   accessed through what().

   Because copying std::logic_error is not permitted to throw exceptions, this message
   is typically stored internally as a separately-allocated reference-counted string.
   This is also why there is no constructor taking std::string&&: it would have to copy
   the content anyway.

.SH Parameters

   what_arg - explanatory string

.SH Exceptions

   May throw std::bad_alloc

Inherited from std::exception
