.SH NAME
std::fgetc,std::getc \- std::fgetc,std::getc

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstdio>
   int fgetc( std::FILE* stream );
   int getc( std::FILE* stream );

   Reads the next character from the given input stream.

.SH Parameters

   stream - to read the character from

.SH Return value

   The obtained character on success or EOF on failure.

   If the failure has been caused by end of file condition, additionally sets the eof
   indicator (see std::feof()) on stream. If the failure has been caused by some other
   error, sets the error indicator (see std::ferror()) on stream.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <cstdio>
 #include <cstdlib>
  
 int main()
 {
     FILE* fp = std::fopen("test.txt", "r");
     if(!fp) {
         std::perror("File opening failed");
         return EXIT_FAILURE;
     }
  
     int c; // note: int, not char, required to handle EOF
     while ((c = std::fgetc(fp)) != EOF) { // standard C I/O file reading loop
        std::putchar(c);
     }
  
     if (std::ferror(fp))
         std::puts("I/O error when reading");
     else if (std::feof(fp))
         std::puts("End of file reached successfully");
  
     std::fclose(fp);
 }
