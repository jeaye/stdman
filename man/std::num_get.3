.SH NAME

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <locale>
   template<

       class CharT,
       class InputIt = std::istreambuf_iterator<CharT>

   > class num_get;

   Class std::num_get encapsulates the rules for parsing string representations of
   numeric values. Specifically, types bool, unsigned short, unsigned int, long,
   unsigned long
   , long long, unsigned long long
   \fI(since C++11)\fP, float, double, long double, and void* are supported. The standard
   formatting input operators (such as cin >> n;) use the std::num_get facet of the I/O
   stream's locale to parse the text representations of the numbers.

                                   Inheritance diagram

   If a std::num_get specialization is not guaranteed to be provided by the standard
   library (see below), the behaviors of its get() and do_get() are not guaranteed as
   specified.

.SH Specializations

   The standard library is guaranteed to provide the following specializations (they
   are required to be implemented by any locale object):

   Defined in header <locale>
   std::num_get<char>    creates narrow string parsing of numbers
   std::num_get<wchar_t> creates wide string parsing of numbers

   In addition, the standard library is also guaranteed to provide every specialization
   that satisfies the following type requirements:

     * CharT is one of
          * char,
          * wchar_t, and
          * any other implementation-defined character container type that meets the
            requirements for a character on which any of the iostream components can be
            instantiated; and
     * InputIt must meet the requirements of LegacyInputIterator.

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <iterator>
 #include <locale>
 #include <sstream>
 #include <string>

 int main()
 {
     std::string de_double = "1.234.567,89";
     std::string us_double = "1,234,567.89";

     // parse using streams
     std::istringstream de_in(de_double);
     de_in.imbue(std::locale("de_DE.UTF-8"));
     double f1;
     de_in >> f1;

     std::istringstream us_in(de_double);
     us_in.imbue(std::locale("en_US.UTF-8"));
     double f2;
     us_in >> f2;

     std::cout << "Parsing " << de_double << " as double gives " << std::fixed
               << f1 << " in de_DE locale and " << f2 << " in en_US\\n";

     // use the facet directly
     std::istringstream s3(us_double);
     s3.imbue(std::locale("en_US.UTF-8"));

     auto& f = std::use_facet<std::num_get<char>>(s3.getloc());
     std::istreambuf_iterator<char> beg(s3), end;
     double f3;
     std::ios::iostate err;
     f.get(beg, end, s3, err, f3);

     std::cout << "parsing " << us_double
               << " as double using raw en_US facet gives " << f3 << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 Parsing 1.234.567,89 as double gives 1234567.890000 in de_DE locale and 1.234000 in en_US
 parsing 1,234,567.89 as double using raw en_US facet gives 1234567.890000
