   class CharT,

   > class time_get_byname : public std::time_get<CharT, InputIterator>

   std::time_get_byname is a std::time_get facet which encapsulates time and date
   parsing rules of the locale specified at its construction.

   Two specializations are provided by the standard library

   Defined in header <locale>
   std::time_get_byname<char, InputIterator>    narrow/multibyte time parsing
   std::time_get_byname<wchar_t, InputIterator> wide string time parsing

   constructor   constructs a new time_get_byname facet
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
   destructor    destroys a time_get_byname facet
                 \fI(protected member function)\fP

                          std::time_get_byname::time_get_byname

   explicit time_get_byname( const char* name, std::size_t refs = 0 );
   explicit time_get_byname( const std::string& name, std::size_t refs =  \fI(since C++11)\fP
   0 );

   Constructs a new std::time_get_byname facet for a locale with name.

   refs is used for resource management: if refs == 0, the implementation destroys the
   facet, when the last std::locale object holding it is destroyed. Otherwise, the
   object is not destroyed.

.SH Parameters

   name - the name of the locale
   refs - the number of references that link to the facet

                          std::time_get_byname::~time_get_byname

   protected:
   ~time_get_byname();

   Destroys the facet.
