.SH NAME
std::basic_ios::rdstate \- std::basic_ios::rdstate

.SH Synopsis
   iostate rdstate() const;

   Returns the current stream error state.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   current stream error state. It is a bitmask type and can be a combination of the
   following constants:

   Constant Explanation
   goodbit  no error
   badbit   irrecoverable stream error
   failbit  input/output operation failed (formatting or extraction error)
   eofbit   associated input sequence has reached end-of-file

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <sstream>
  
 int main()
 {
   std::ostringstream stream;
  
   if (stream.rdstate() == std::ios_base::goodbit) {
     std::cout << "stream state is goodbit\\n";
   }
  
   stream.setstate(std::ios_base::eofbit);
  
   // check state is exactly eofbit (no failbit and no badbit)
   if (stream.rdstate() == std::ios_base::eofbit) {
     std::cout << "stream state is eofbit\\n";
   }
 }

.SH Output:

 stream state is goodbit
 stream state is eofbit
