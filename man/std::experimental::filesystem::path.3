.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/filesystem>
   class path;                                  (filesystem TS)

   Objects of type path represent paths on a filesystem. Only syntactic aspects of
   paths are handled: the pathname may represent a non-existing path or even one that
   is not allowed to exist on the current file system or OS.

   The path name has the following syntax:

    1. root-name(optional): identifies the root on a filesystem with multiple roots
       (such as "C:" or "//myserver". POSIX filesystems have single root.
    2. root-directory(optional): a directory separator that, if present, marks this
       path as absolute. If it is missing (and the first element other than the root
       name is a file name), then the path is relative and requires another path as the
       starting location to resolve to a file name.
    3. Zero or more of the following:

              * file-name: sequence of characters that aren't directory separators or
                preferred directory separators (additional limitations may be imposed
                by the OS or file system). This name may identify a file, a hard link,
                a symbolic link, or a directory. Two special file-names are recognized:

                           * dot: the file name consisting of a single dot character .
                             is a directory name that refers to the current directory
                           * dot-dot: the file name consisting of two dot characters ..
                             is a directory name that refers to the parent directory.

              * directory-separators: the forward slash character / or the alternative
                character provided as path::preferred_separator. If this character is
                repeated, it is treated as a single directory separator: /usr///////lib
                is the same as /usr/lib

   The path can be traversed element-wise via iterators returned by the begin() and
   end() functions, which iterates over root name, root directory, and the subsequent
   file name elements (directory separators are skipped except the one that identifies
   the root directory). If the very last element in the path is a directory separator,
   the last iterator will dereference to a file name dot.

   Calling any non-const member function of a path invalidates all iterators referring
   to elements of that object.

   If the OS uses a native syntax that is different from the portable generic syntax
   described above, all library functions accept path names in both formats.

   Paths are implicitly convertible to and from std::basic_strings, which makes it
   possible to use them with other file APIs, e.g. as an argument to
   std::ifstream::open

.SH Member types

   Type           Definition
   value_type     character type used by the native encoding of the filesystem: char on
                  POSIX, wchar_t on Windows
   string_type    std::basic_string<value_type>
   const_iterator a constant LegacyBidirectionalIterator with a value_type of path
   iterator       an alias to const_iterator

.SH Member constants

                        alternative directory separator which may be used in addition
   constexpr value_type to the portable /. On Windows, this is the backslash character
   preferred_separator  \\. On POSIX, this is the same forward slash / as the portable
   \fB[static]\fP             separator
