.SH NAME
std::ratio_greater \- std::ratio_greater

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <ratio>
   template< class R1, class R2 >                  \fI(since C++11)\fP
   struct ratio_greater : std::integral_constant;

   If the ratio R1 is greater than than the ratio R2, provides the member constant
   value equal true. Otherwise, value is false.

.SH Member constants

   value    true if R1::num * R2::den > R2::num * R1::den, or equivalent expression
   \fB[static]\fP that avoids overflow , false otherwise
            \fI(public static member constant)\fP

.SH Member functions

   operator bool converts the object to bool, returns value
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
   operator()    returns value
   \fI(C++14)\fP       \fI(public member function)\fP
