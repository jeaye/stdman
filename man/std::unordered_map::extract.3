.SH NAME
std::unordered_map::extract \- std::unordered_map::extract

.SH Synopsis
   node_type extract( const_iterator position ); \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   node_type extract( const Key& k );            \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   template< class K >                           \fB(3)\fP (since C++23)
   node_type extract( K&& x );

   1) Unlinks the node that contains the element pointed to by position and returns a
   node handle that owns it.
   2) If the container has an element with key equivalent to k, unlinks the node that
   contains that element from the container and returns a node handle that owns it.
   Otherwise, returns an empty node handle.
   3) Same as \fB(2)\fP. This overload participates in overload resolution only if
   Hash::is_transparent and KeyEqual::is_transparent are valid and each denotes a type,
   and neither iterator nor const_iterator is implicitly convertible from K. This
   assumes that such Hash is callable with both K and Key type, and that the KeyEqual
   is transparent, which, together, allows calling this function without constructing
   an instance of Key.

   In either case, no elements are copied or moved, only the internal pointers of the
   container nodes are repointed

   Extracting a node invalidates only the iterators to the extracted element, and
   preserves the relative order of the elements that are not erased. Pointers and
   references to the extracted element remain valid, but cannot be used while element
   is owned by a node handle: they become usable if the element is inserted into a
   container.

.SH Parameters

   position - a valid iterator into this container
   k        - a key to identify the node to be extracted
   x        - a value of any type that can be transparently compared with a key
              identifying the node to be extracted

.SH Return value

   A node handle that owns the extracted element, or empty node handle in case the
   element is not found in (2,3).

.SH Exceptions

   1) Throws nothing.
   2,3) Any exceptions thrown by the Hash and KeyEqual object.

.SH Complexity

   1,2,3) Average case O(1), worst case O(a.size()).

.SH Notes

   extract is the only way to change a key of a map element without reallocation:

 map<int, string> m{{1, "mango"}, {2, "papaya"}, {3, "guava"}};
 auto nh = m.extract\fB(2)\fP;
 nh.key() = 4;
 m.insert(move(nh));
 // m == {{1, "mango"}, {3, "guava"}, {4, "papaya"}}

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <algorithm>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <unordered_map>

 int main()
 {
     std::unordered_map<int, char> cont{{1, 'a'}, {2, 'b'}, {3, 'c'}};

     auto print = [](std::pair<const int, char>& n) {
         std::cout << " " << n.first << '(' << n.second << ')';
     };

     std::cout << "Start:";
     std::for_each(cont.begin(), cont.end(), print);
     std::cout << '\\n';

     // Extract node handle and change key
     auto nh = cont.extract(1);
     nh.key() = 4;

     std::cout << "After extract and before insert:";
     std::for_each(cont.begin(), cont.end(), print);
     std::cout << '\\n';

     // Insert node handle back
     cont.insert(move(nh));

     std::cout << "End:";
     std::for_each(cont.begin(), cont.end(), print);
     std::cout << '\\n';
 }

.SH Possible output:

 Start: 1(a) 2(b) 3(c)
 After extract and before insert: 2(b) 3(c)
 End: 2(b) 3(c) 4(a)
