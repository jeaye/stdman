.TH std::ws 3 "Nov 16 2016" "2.1 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::ws \- std::ws

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <istream>
   template< class CharT, class Traits >
   std::basic_istream<CharT,Traits>& ws( std::basic_istream<CharT, Traits>& is );

   Discards leading whitespace from an input stream.

   Behaves as an UnformattedInputFunction, except that is.gcount() is not modified.
   After constructing and checking the sentry object, extracts characters from the
   stream and discards them until any one of the following conditions occurs:

     * end of file condition occurs in the input sequence (in which case the function
       calls setstate(eofbit) but does not set failbit.

     * the next available character c in the input sequence is not whitespace as
       determined by std::isspace(c, is.getloc()). The non-whitespace character is not
       extracted.

   This is an input-only I/O manipulator, it may be called with an expression such as
   in >> std::ws for any in of type std::basic_istream.

.SH Parameters

   is - reference to input stream

.SH Return value

   is (reference to the stream after extraction of consecutive whitespace)

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <sstream>

 int main()
 {
     std::istringstream s("     this is a test");
     std::string line;
     getline(s >> std::ws, line);
     std::cout << "ws + getline returns: \\"" << line << "\\"\\n";
 }

.SH Output:

 ws + getline returns: "this is a test"
