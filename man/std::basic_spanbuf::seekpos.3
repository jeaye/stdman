.SH NAME
std::basic_spanbuf::seekpos \- std::basic_spanbuf::seekpos

.SH Synopsis
   protected:

   pos_type seekpos( pos_type sp, std::ios_base::openmode which =         (since C++23)

                         std::ios_base::in | std::ios_base::out )
   override;

   Repositions the next pointer to the get and/or put area, if possible, to the
   position indicated by sp.

   Equivalent to return seekoff(off_type(sp), std::ios_base::beg, which);.

.SH Parameters

   sp    - stream position, such as one obtained by seekoff() or seekpos()
           defines whether the input sequences, the output sequence, or both are
           affected. It can be one or a combination of the following constants:
   which -
           Constant Explanation
           in       affect the input sequence
           out      affect the output sequence

.SH Return value

   sp on success or pos_type(off_type(-1)) on failure.

.SH Notes

   seekpos() is called by std::basic_streambuf::pubseekpos(), which is called by the
   single-argument versions of std::basic_istream::seekg() and
   std::basic_ostream::seekp().
