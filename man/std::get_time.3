.SH NAME
std::get_time \- std::get_time

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <iomanip>
   template< class CharT >                                      \fI(since C++11)\fP
   /*unspecified*/ get_time( std::tm* tmb, const CharT* fmt );

   When used in an expression in >> get_time(tmb, fmt), parses the character input as a
   date/time value according to format string fmt according to the std::time_get facet
   of the locale currently imbued in the input stream in. The resultant value is stored
   in a std::tm object pointed to by tmb.

.SH Parameters

   tmb - valid pointer to the std::tm object where the result will be stored
         pointer to a null-terminated CharT string specifying the conversion format

         The format string consists of zero or more conversion specifiers, whitespace
         characters, and ordinary characters (except %). Each ordinary character is
         expected to match one character in the input stream in case-insensitive
         comparison. Each whitespace character matches arbitrary whitespace in the
         input string. Each conversion specification begins with % character,
         optionally followed by E or O modifier (ignored if unsupported by the locale),
         followed by the character that determines the behavior of the specifier. The
         format specifiers match the POSIX function strptime():

                    parses the locale's alternative date and time
             Ec     string format, e.g. expecting Âπ≥Êàê23Âπ¥ (year   all

         Note: tm_isdst is not written to, and needs to be set explicitly for use with
         functions such as mktime

.SH Return value

   Returns an object of unspecified type such that if in is the name of an input stream
   of type std::basic_istream<CharT, Traits>, then the expression in >> get_time(tmb,
   fmt) behaves as if the following code was executed:

   typedef std::istreambuf_iterator<CharT, Traits> Iter;
   typedef std::time_get<CharT, Iter> TimeGet;
   std::ios_base::iostate err = std::ios_base::goodbit;
   const TimeGet& tg = std::use_facet<TimeGet>(in.getloc());
   tg.get(Iter(in.rdbuf()), Iter(), in, err, tmb, fmt, fmt + traits::length(fmt));
   if (err != std::ios_base::goodbit)
   in.setstate(err);

.SH Notes

   As specified in std::time_get::do_get, which this function calls, it's unspecified
   if this function zero out the fields in *tmb that are not set directly by the
   conversion specifiers that appear in fmt: portable programs should initialize every
   field of *tmb to zero before calling std::get_time.

.SH Example

   note: choose clang to observe the output. libstdc++ does not correctly implement the
   %b specifier: bug 78714
