std::chrono::operator<<(std::chrono::zoned_time) \- std::chrono::operator<<(std::chrono::zoned_time)

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <chrono>
   template <class CharT, class Traits, class Duration, class
   TimeZonePtr>

   std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>&                                     \fI(since C++20)\fP
   operator<<( std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& os,

   const std::chrono::zoned_time<Duration, TimeZonePtr>& tp );

   Outputs tp to the stream os, as if by std::format(os.getloc(), fmt, tp), where fmt
   is "{:L%F %T %Z}" if CharT is char, or L"{:L%F %T %Z}" if CharT is wchar_t.

.SH Parameters

   os - output stream
   tp - zoned_time to output

.SH Return value
