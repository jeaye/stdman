.SH NAME
std::gamma_distribution \- std::gamma_distribution

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <random>
   template< class RealType = double >  \fI(since C++11)\fP
   class gamma_distribution;

   Produces random positive floating-point values x, distributed according to
   probability density function:

           P(x|α,β) =

           e-x/β
           βα
           · Γ(α)

           · xα-1

   where α is known as the shape parameter and β is known as the scale parameter. The
   shape parameter is sometimes denoted by the letter k and the scale parameter is
   sometimes denoted by the letter θ.

   For floating-point α, the value obtained is the sum of α independent exponentially
   distributed random variables, each of which has a mean of β

   std::gamma_distribution satisfies RandomNumberDistribution

.SH Template parameters

   RealType - The result type generated by the generator. The effect is undefined if
              this is not one of float, double, or long double.

.SH Member types

   Member type Definition
   result_type RealType
   param_type  the type of the parameter set, see RandomNumberDistribution.

.SH Member functions

   constructor   constructs new distribution
