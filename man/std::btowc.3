.TH std::btowc 3 "Nov 25 2015" "2.0 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::btowc \- std::btowc

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cwchar>
   std::wint_t btowc( int c );

   Widens a single-byte character c to its wide character equivalent.

   Most multibyte character encodings use single-byte codes to represent the characters
   from the ASCII character set. This function may be used to convert such characters
   to wchar_t.

.SH Parameters

   c - single-byte character to widen

.SH Return value

   WEOF if c is EOF.

   Wide character representation of c if (unsigned char)c is a valid single-byte
   character in the initial shift state, WEOF otherwise.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <cwchar>
 #include <clocale>
  
 void try_widen(char c)
 {
     std::wint_t w = std::btowc(c);
     if(w != WEOF)
         std::cout << "The single-byte character " << +(unsigned char)c
                   << " widens to " << +w << '\\n';
     else
         std::cout << "The single-byte character " << +(unsigned char)c
                   << " failed to widen\\n";
 }
  
 int main()
 {
     std::setlocale(LC_ALL, "lt_LT.iso88594");
     std::cout << std::hex << std::showbase << "In Lithuanian ISO-8859-4 locale:\\n";
     try_widen('A');
     try_widen('\\xdf'); // German letter ß (U+00df) in ISO-8859-4
     try_widen('\\xf9'); // Lithuanian letter ų (U+0173) in ISO-8859-4
  
     std::setlocale(LC_ALL, "lt_LT.utf8");
     std::cout << "In Lithuanian UTF-8 locale:\\n";
     try_widen('A');
     try_widen('\\xdf');
     try_widen('\\xf9');
 }

.SH Output:

 In Lithuanian ISO-8859-4 locale:
 The single-byte character 0x41 widens to 0x41
 The single-byte character 0xdf widens to 0xdf
 The single-byte character 0xf9 widens to 0x173
 In Lithuanian UTF-8 locale:
 The single-byte character 0x41 widens to 0x41
 The single-byte character 0xdf failed to widen
 The single-byte character 0xf9 failed to widen
