.TH std::queue::swap 3 "2022.03.29" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::queue::swap \- std::queue::swap

.SH Synopsis
   void swap( queue& other ) noexcept(/* see below */);  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Exchanges the contents of the container adaptor with those of other. Effectively
   calls using std::swap; swap(c, other.c);

.SH Parameters

   other - container adaptor to exchange the contents with

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Exceptions

   noexcept specification:
   noexcept(noexcept(swap(c, other.c)))                                   \fI(since C++11)\fP
                                                                          \fI(until C++17)\fP
   In the expression above, the identifier swap is looked up in the same
   manner as the one used by the C++17 std::is_nothrow_swappable trait.
   noexcept specification:                                                \fI(since C++17)\fP
   noexcept(std::is_nothrow_swappable_v<Container>)

.SH Complexity

   Same as underlying container (typically constant).

.SH Notes

   Some implementations (e.g. libc++) provide the swap member function as an extension
   to pre-C++11 modes.
