.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstdio>
   int printf( const char* format, ... );                             \fB(1)\fP
   int fprintf( std::FILE* stream, const char* format, ... );         \fB(2)\fP
   int sprintf( char* buffer, const char* format, ... );              \fB(3)\fP
   int snprintf( char* buffer, std::size_t buf_size, const char*      \fB(4)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   format, ... );

   Loads the data from the given locations, converts them to character string
   equivalents and writes the results to a variety of sinks.

   1) Writes the results to stdout.
   2) Writes the results to a file stream stream.
   3) Writes the results to a character string buffer.
   4) Writes the results to a character string buffer. At most buf_size - 1 characters
   are written. The resulting character string will be terminated with a null
   character, unless buf_size is zero. If buf_size is zero, nothing is written and
   buffer may be a null pointer, however the return value (number of bytes that would
   be written) is still calculated and returned.

   If a call to sprintf or snprintf causes copying to take place between objects that
   overlap, the behavior is undefined.

.SH Parameters

stream   - output file stream to write to
buffer   - pointer to a character string to write to
buf_size - up to buf_size - 1 characters may be written, plus the null terminator
           pointer to a null-terminated multibyte string specifying how to interpret the data.

           The format string consists of ordinary multibyte characters (except %), which are copied unchanged into the
           output stream, and conversion specifications. Each conversion specification has the following format:

                 * introductory % character

                 * (optional) one or more flags that modify the behavior of the conversion:

                         * -: the result of the conversion is left-justified within the field (by default it is
                           right-justified)
                         * +: the sign of signed conversions is always prepended to the result of the conversion (by
                           default the result is preceded by minus only when it is negative)
                         * space: if the result of a signed conversion does not start with a sign character, or is
                           empty, space is prepended to the result. It is ignored if + flag is present.
                         * # : alternative form of the conversion is performed. See the table below for exact effects
                           otherwise the behavior is undefined.
                         * 0 : for integer and floating point number conversions, leading zeros are used to pad the
                           field instead of space characters. For integer numbers it is ignored if the precision is
                           explicitly specified. For other conversions using this flag results in undefined behavior. It
                           is ignored if - flag is present.

                 * (optional) integer value or * that specifies minimum field width. The result is padded with space
                   characters (by default), if required, on the left when right-justified, or on the right if
                   left-justified. In the case when * is used, the width is specified by an additional argument of type
                   int. If the value of the argument is negative, it results with the - flag specified and positive
                   field width. (Note: This is the minimum width: The value is never truncated.)

                 * (optional) . followed by integer number or *, or neither that specifies precision of the conversion.
                   In the case when * is used, the precision is specified by an additional argument of type int. If the
                   value of this argument is negative, it is ignored. If neither a number nor * is used, the precision
                   is taken as zero. See the table below for exact effects of precision.

                 * (optional) length modifier that specifies the size of the argument

                 * conversion format specifier

           The following format specifiers are available:

           The floating point conversion functions convert infinity to inf or infinity. Which one is used is
           implementation defined.

           Not-a-number is converted to nan or nan(char_sequence). Which one is used is implementation defined.

           The conversions F, E, G, A output INF, INFINITY, NAN instead.

           Even though %c expects int argument, it is safe to pass a char because of the integer promotion that takes
           place when a variadic function is called.

           The correct conversion specifications for the fixed-width character types (int8_t, etc) are defined in the
           header <cinttypes> (although PRIdMAX, PRIuMAX, etc is synonymous with %jd, %ju, etc).

           The memory-writing conversion specifier %n is a common target of security exploits where format strings
           depend on user input and is not supported by the bounds-checked printf_s family of functions.

           There is a sequence point after the action of each conversion specifier; this permits storing multiple %n
           results in the same variable or, as an edge case, printing a string modified by an earlier %n within the same
           call.

           If a conversion specification is invalid, the behavior is undefined.
           arguments specifying data to print. If any argument after default conversions is not the type expected by the
...      - corresponding conversion specifier, or if there are fewer arguments than required by format, the behavior is
           undefined. If there are more arguments than required by format, the extraneous arguments are evaluated and
           ignored

.SH Return value

   1-2) Number of characters written if successful or a negative value if an error
   occurred.
   3) Number of characters written if successful (not including the terminating null
   character) or a negative value if an error occurred.
   4) Number of characters that would have been written for a sufficiently large buffer
   if successful (not including the terminating null character), or a negative value if
   an error occurred. Thus, the (null-terminated) output has been completely written if
   and only if the returned value is nonnegative and less than buf_size.

.SH Notes

   POSIX specifies that errno is set on error. It also specifies additional conversion
   specifications, most notably support for argument reordering (n$ immediately after %
   indicates n'th argument)

   Calling std::snprintf with zero buf_size and null pointer for buffer is useful to
   determine the necessary buffer size to contain the output:

 const char *fmt = "sqrt\fB(2)\fP = %f";
 int sz = std::snprintf(nullptr, 0, fmt, std::sqrt\fB(2)\fP);
 std::vector<char> buf(sz + 1); // note +1 for null terminator
 std::snprintf(&buf[0], buf.size(), fmt, std::sqrt\fB(2)\fP);
