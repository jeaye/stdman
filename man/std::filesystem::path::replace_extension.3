.SH NAME
std::filesystem::path::replace_extension \- std::filesystem::path::replace_extension

.SH Synopsis
   path& replace_extension( const path& replacement = path() ); \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP

   Replaces the extension with replacement or removes it when the default value of
   replacement is used.

   Firstly, if this path has an extension(), it is removed from the generic-format view
   of the pathname.

   Then, a dot character is appended to the generic-format view of the pathname, if
   replacement is not empty or does not begin with a dot character.

   Then replacement is appended as if by operator+=(replacement)

.SH Parameters

   replacement - the extension to replace with

.SH Return value

   *this

.SH Exceptions

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Notes

   The type of replacement is std::filesystem::path even though it is not intended to
   represent an object on the file system in order to correctly account for the
   filesystem character encoding.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <filesystem>
 namespace fs = std::filesystem;

 int main()
 {
     fs::path p = "/foo/bar.jpeg";
     std::cout << "Was: " << p << '\\n';
     p.replace_extension(".jpg");
     std::cout << "Now: " << p << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 Was: "/foo/bar.jpeg"
 Now: "/foo/bar.jpg"
