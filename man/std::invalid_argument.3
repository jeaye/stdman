.SH NAME
std::invalid_argument \- std::invalid_argument

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <stdexcept>
   class invalid_argument;

   Defines a type of object to be thrown as exception. It reports errors that arise
   because an argument value has not been accepted.

   This exception is thrown by std::bitset::bitset, and the std::stoi and std::stof
   families of functions.

.SH Member functions

   constructor   constructs the exception object
                 \fI(public member function)\fP

std::invalid_argument::invalid_argument

   explicit invalid_argument( const std::string& what_arg ); \fB(1)\fP
   explicit invalid_argument( const char* what_arg );        \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Constructs the exception object with what_arg as explanatory string that can be
   accessed through what().

   Because copying std::exception is not permitted to throw exceptions, this message is
   typically stored internally as a separately-allocated reference-counted string. This
   is also why there is no constructor taking std::string&&: it would have to copy the
   content anyway.

.SH Parameters

   what_arg - explanatory string

.SH Exceptions

   May throw std::bad_alloc

Inherited from std::exception

.SH Member functions

   destructor   destructs the exception object
   \fB[virtual]\fP    \fI(virtual public member function of std::exception)\fP
   what         returns an explanatory string
   \fB[virtual]\fP    \fI(virtual public member function of std::exception)\fP

.SH Notes

   The purpose of this exception type is similar to the error condition
   std::errc::invalid_argument (thrown in std::system_error from member functions of
   std::thread) and the related errno constant EINVAL.
