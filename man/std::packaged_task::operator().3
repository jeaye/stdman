.SH NAME
std::packaged_task::operator() \- std::packaged_task::operator()

.SH Synopsis
   void operator()( ArgTypes... args );  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Calls the stored task with args as the arguments. The return value of the task or
   any exceptions thrown are stored in the shared state. The shared state is made ready
   and any threads waiting for this are unblocked.

.SH Parameters

   args - the parameters to pass on invocation of the stored task

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Exceptions

   std::future_error on the following error conditions:

     * The stored task has already been invoked. The error category is set to
       promise_already_satisfied.
     * *this has no shared state. The error category is set to no_state.

.SH Notes

   A successful call to operator() synchronizes with a call to any member
   function of a std::future or std::shared_future that share their       \fI(until C++14)\fP
   shared state with *this.
   No additional synchronization guarantees other than what's already     \fI(since C++14)\fP
   provided by shared state.
