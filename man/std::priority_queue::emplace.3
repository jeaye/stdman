.TH std::priority_queue::emplace 3 "Sep  4 2015" "2.0 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   template< class... Args >        \fI(since C++11)\fP
   void emplace( Args&&... args );

   Pushes new element to the priority queue. The element is constructed in-place, i.e.
   no copy or move operations are performed. The constructor of the element is called
   with exactly the same arguments as supplied to the function.

   Effectively calls c.emplace_back(std::forward<Args>(args)...);
   std::push_heap(c.begin(), c.end(), comp);

.SH Parameters

   args - arguments to forward to the constructor of the element

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Complexity

   Logarithmic number of comparisons plus the complexity of Container::emplace_back.
