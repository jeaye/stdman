.SH NAME
std::basic_stacktrace::max_size \- std::basic_stacktrace::max_size

.SH Synopsis
   size_type max_size() const noexcept;  (since C++23)

   Returns the maximum number of elements the underlying container (typically a
   std::vector) is able to hold due to system or library implementation limitations,
   i.e. std::distance(begin(), end()) for the largest underlying container.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   Maximum number of elements.

.SH Complexity

   Constant.

.SH Notes

   This value typically reflects the theoretical limit on the size of the underlying
   container, at most std::numeric_limits<difference_type>::max(). At runtime, the size
   of the container may be limited to a value smaller than max_size() by the amount of
   RAM available.

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <stacktrace>

 int main()
 {
     std::stacktrace trace;
     std::cout << "Maximum size of a 'basic_stacktrace' is " << trace.max_size() << "\\n";
 }

.SH Possible output:

 Maximum size of a 'basic_stacktrace' is 1152921504606846975
