.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <chrono>

 int main()
 {
     for (const unsigned u : {0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9}) {
         const std::chrono::weekday wd{u};
         std::cout
             << "u = " << u << ", wd = "
             << wd.c_encoding() // Monday is 1
             << (wd.ok() ? " is a valid weekday.\\n"
                         : " is an invalid weekday!\\n");
