.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <iterator>
   template<class I>

   concept weakly_incrementable =
   std::movable<I> &&
   requires(I i) {                                                         (since
   typename std::iter_difference_t<I>;                                     C++20)
   requires /*is-signed-integer-like*/<std::iter_difference_t<I>>;
   { ++i } -> std::same_as<I&>; // not required to be equality-preserving
   i++; // not required to be equality-preserving

   };

   where /*is-signed-integer-like*/<I> is true if and only if I is a
   signed-integer-like type (see below).

   This concept specifies requirements on types that can be incremented with the pre-
   and post-increment operators, but those increment operations are not necessarily
   equality-preserving, and the type itself is not required to be
   std::equality_comparable.

   For std::weakly_incrementable types, a == b does not imply that ++a == ++b.
   Algorithms on weakly incrementable types must be single-pass algorithms. These
   algorithms can be used with istreams as the source of the input data through
   std::istream_iterator.

  Semantic requirements

   I models std::weakly_incrementable only if given only object i of type I:

     * The expressions ++i and i++ have the same domain
     * If i is incrementable, then both ++i and i++ advance i
     * If i is incrementable, then std::addressof(++i) == std::addressof(i)

  Integer-like types

   An integer-like type is an (possibly cv-qualified) integer type (except for cv bool)
   or an implementation-provided (not user-provided) class that behaves like an integer
   type, including all operators, implicit conversions, and std::numeric_limits
   specializations. If an integer-like type only represents non-negative values, it is
   unsigned-integer-like, otherwise it is signed-integer-like.

   incrementable specifies that the increment operation on a weakly_incrementable type
   (C++20)       is equality-preserving and that the type is equality_comparable
