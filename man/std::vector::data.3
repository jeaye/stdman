.SH NAME
std::vector::data \- std::vector::data

.SH Synopsis
   T* data();              \fI(since C++11)\fP
   const T* data() const;  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Returns pointer to the underlying array serving as element storage. The pointer is
   such that range [data(); data() + size()) is always a valid range, even if the
   container is empty (data() is not dereferenceable in that case).

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   Pointer to the underlying element storage. For non-empty containers, returns
   &front()

.SH Complexity

   Constant.

.SH Exceptions

   noexcept specification:  
   noexcept
