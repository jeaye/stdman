.SH NAME
std::thread::hardware_concurrency \- std::thread::hardware_concurrency

.SH Synopsis
   static unsigned hardware_concurrency();  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Returns the number of concurrent threads supported by the implementation. The value
   should be considered only a hint.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   number of concurrent threads supported. If the value is not well defined or not
   computable, returns 0.

.SH Exceptions

   noexcept specification:  
   noexcept
     

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <thread>
  
 int main() {
     unsigned int n = std::thread::hardware_concurrency();
     std::cout << n << " concurrent threads are supported.\\n";
 }

.SH Possible output:

 4 concurrent threads are supported.
