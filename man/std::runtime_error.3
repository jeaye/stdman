.SH NAME
std::runtime_error \- std::runtime_error

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <stdexcept>
   class runtime_error;

   Defines a type of object to be thrown as exception. It reports errors that are due
   to events beyond the scope of the program and can not be easily predicted.

   Exceptions of type std::runtime_error are thrown by the following standard library
   components: std::locale::locale and std::locale::combine.

   In addition, the standard exception types std::range_error, std::overflow_error,
   std::underflow_error, std::regex_error, and std::system_error are derived from
   std::runtime_error.

.SH Member functions

   constructor   constructs the exception object
                 \fI(public member function)\fP 

   

std::runtime_error::runtime_error

   explicit runtime_error( const std::string& what_arg ); \fB(1)\fP
   explicit runtime_error( const char* what_arg );        \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Constructs the exception object with what_arg as explanatory string that can be
   accessed through what().

   Because copying std::exception is not permitted to throw exceptions, this message is
   typically stored internally as a separately-allocated reference-counted string. This
   is also why there is no constructor taking std::string&&: it would have to copy the
   content anyway.

.SH Parameters

   what_arg - explanatory string

.SH Exceptions

   May throw std::bad_alloc

Inherited from std::exception
