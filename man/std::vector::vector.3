   Constructs a new container from a variety of data sources, optionally using a user
   supplied allocator alloc.

   1) Default constructor. Constructs an empty container. If no allocator is supplied,
   allocator is obtained from a default-constructed instance.
   2) Constructs the container with count copies of elements with value value.
   3) Constructs the container with count default-inserted instances of T. No copies
   are made.
   4) Constructs the container with the contents of the range [first, last).

   This constructor has the same effect as
   vector(static_cast<size_type>(first), static_cast<value_type>(last),   \fI(until C++11)\fP
   a) if InputIt is an integral type.
   This overload only participates in overload resolution if InputIt
   satisfies LegacyInputIterator, to avoid ambiguity with the overload    \fI(since C++11)\fP
   \fB(2)\fP.

   5) Copy constructor. Constructs the container with the copy of the contents of
   other. If alloc is not provided, allocator is obtained as if by calling
   std::allocator_traits<allocator_type>::select_on_container_copy_construction(other.get_allocator()).
   6) Move constructor. Constructs the container with the contents of other using move
   semantics. Allocator is obtained by move-construction from the allocator belonging
   to other. After the move, other is guaranteed to be empty().
   7) Allocator-extended move constructor. Using alloc as the allocator for the new
   container, moving the contents from other; if alloc != other.get_allocator(), this
   results in an element-wise move. (in that case, other is not guaranteed to be empty
   after the move)
   8) Constructs the container with the contents of the initializer list init.

.SH Parameters

   alloc       - allocator to use for all memory allocations of this container
   count       - the size of the container
   value       - the value to initialize elements of the container with
   first, last - the range to copy the elements from
   other       - another container to be used as source to initialize the elements of
                 the container with
   init        - initializer list to initialize the elements of the container with

.SH Complexity

   1) Constant
   2-3) Linear in count
   4) Linear in distance between first and last
   5) Linear in size of other
   6) Constant.
   7) Linear if alloc != other.get_allocator(), otherwise constant.
   8) Linear in size of init.

.SH Exceptions

   Calls to Allocator::allocate may throw.

.SH Notes

   After container move construction (overload \fB(6)\fP), references, pointers, and
   iterators (other than the end iterator) to other remain valid, but refer to elements
   that are now in *this. The current standard makes this guarantee via the blanket
   statement in §23.2.1[container.requirements.general]/12, and a more direct guarantee
   is under consideration via LWG 2321.
   The overload \fB(3)\fP zeroes out elements of non-class types such as int, which is
   different from the behavior of new[], which leaves them uninitialized. To match the
   behavior of new[], a custom Allocator::construct can be provided which leaves such
   elements uninitialized.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <vector>
 #include <string>
 #include <iostream>
  
 template<typename T>
 std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& s, const std::vector<T>& v) {
     s.put('[');
     char comma[3] = {'\\0', ' ', '\\0'};
     for (const auto& e : v) {
         s << comma << e;
         comma[0] = ',';
     }
     return s << ']';
 }
  
 int main()
 {
     // c++11 initializer list syntax:
     std::vector<std::string> words1 {"the", "frogurt", "is", "also", "cursed"};
     std::cout << "words1: " << words1 << '\\n';
  
     // words2 == words1
     std::vector<std::string> words2(words1.begin(), words1.end());
     std::cout << "words2: " << words2 << '\\n';
  
     // words3 == words1
     std::vector<std::string> words3(words1);
     std::cout << "words3: " << words3 << '\\n';
  
     // words4 is {"Mo", "Mo", "Mo", "Mo", "Mo"}
     std::vector<std::string> words4(5, "Mo");
     std::cout << "words4: " << words4 << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 words1: [the, frogurt, is, also, cursed]
 words2: [the, frogurt, is, also, cursed]
 words3: [the, frogurt, is, also, cursed]
 words4: [Mo, Mo, Mo, Mo, Mo]
