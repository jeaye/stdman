   Constructs a new container from a variety of data sources, optionally using a user
   supplied allocator alloc.

   1) Default constructor. Constructs an empty container.
   2) Constructs the container with count copies of elements with value value.
   3) Constructs the container with count default-inserted instances of T. No copies
   are made.
   4) Constructs the container with the contents of the range [first, last).

   This constructor has the same effect as overload \fB(2)\fP if InputIt is an  \fI(until C++11)\fP
   integral type.
   This overload only participates in overload resolution if InputIt      \fI(since C++11)\fP
   satisfies InputIterator, to avoid ambiguity with the overload \fB(2)\fP.

   5) Copy constructor. Constructs the container with the copy of the contents of
   other. If alloc is not provided, allocator is obtained as if by calling
   std::allocator_traits<allocator_type>::select_on_container_copy_construction(other.get_allocator()).
   6) Move constructor. Constructs the container with the contents of other using move
   semantics. If alloc is not provided, allocator is obtained by move-construction from
   the allocator belonging to other.
   7) Constructs the container with the contents of the initializer list init.

.SH Parameters

   alloc       - allocator to use for all memory allocations of this container
   count       - the size of the container
   value       - the value to initialize elements of the container with
   first, last - the range to copy the elements from
   other       - another container to be used as source to initialize the elements of
                 the container with
   init        - initializer list to initialize the elements of the container with

.SH Complexity

   1) Constant
   2-3) Linear in count
   4) Linear in distance between first and last
   5) Linear in size of other
   6) Constant. If alloc is given and alloc != other.get_allocator(), then linear.
   7) Linear in size of init

.SH Notes

   After container move construction (overload \fB(6)\fP), references, pointers, and
   iterators (other than the end iterator) to other remain valid, but refer to elements
   that are now in *this. The current standard makes this guarantee via the blanket
   statement in §23.2.1[container.requirements.general]/12, and a more direct guarantee
   is under consideration via LWG 2321. The overload \fB(3)\fP zeroes out elements of
   non-class types such as int, which is different from the behavior of new[] , which
   leaves them uninitialized. To match the behavior of new[], a custom
   Allocator::construct can be provided which leaves such elements uninitialized.

.SH Exceptions

   1)
   noexcept specification: if alloc is not given
   noexcept(noexcept(Allocator()))
   noexcept specification:                       \fI(since C++17)\fP
   noexcept
   if alloc is given
   6)
   noexcept specification:
   noexcept
   if alloc is not given

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <vector>
 #include <string>
 #include <iostream>

 template<typename T>
 std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& s, const std::vector<T>& v) {
     s.put('[');
     char comma[3] = {'\\0', ' ', '\\0'};
     for (const auto& e : v) {
         s << comma << e;
         comma[0] = ',';
     }
     return s << ']';
 }

 int main()
 {
     // c++11 initializer list syntax:
     std::vector<std::string> words1 {"the", "frogurt", "is", "also", "cursed"};
     std::cout << "words1: " << words1 << '\\n';

     // words2 == words1
     std::vector<std::string> words2(words1.begin(), words1.end());
     std::cout << "words2: " << words2 << '\\n';

     // words3 == words1
     std::vector<std::string> words3(words1);
     std::cout << "words3: " << words3 << '\\n';

     // words4 is {"Mo", "Mo", "Mo", "Mo", "Mo"}
     std::vector<std::string> words4(5, "Mo");
     std::cout << "words4: " << words4 << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 words1: [the, frogurt, is, also, cursed]
 words2: [the, frogurt, is, also, cursed]
 words3: [the, frogurt, is, also, cursed]
 words4: [Mo, Mo, Mo, Mo, Mo]
