.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <mutex>
   template< class... MutexTypes >  \fI(since C++17)\fP
   class scoped_lock;

   The class scoped_lock is a mutex wrapper that provides a convenient RAII-style
   mechanism for owning one or more mutexes for the duration of a scoped block.

   When a scoped_lock object is created, it attempts to take ownership of the mutexes
   it is given. When control leaves the scope in which the scoped_lock object was
   created, the scoped_lock is destructed and the mutexes are released, in reverse
   order. If several mutexes are given, deadlock avoidance algorithm is used as if by
   std::lock.

   The scoped_lock class is non-copyable.

.SH Template parameters

                the types of the mutexes to lock. The types must meet the Lockable
   MutexTypes - requirements unless sizeof...(MutexTypes)==1, in which case the only
                type must meet BasicLockable

.SH Member types

   Member type                              Definition
   mutex_type (if sizeof...(MutexTypes)==1) Mutex, the sole type in MutexTypes...

.SH Member functions

   constructor   constructs a scoped_lock, optionally locking the given mutexes
                 \fI(public member function)\fP 
   destructor    destructs the scoped_lock object, unlocks the underlying mutexes
                 \fI(public member function)\fP 
   operator=     not copy-assignable

.SH Example

   The following example uses std::scoped_lock to lock pairs of mutexes without
   deadlock and is RAII-style.

   
// Run this code

 #include <mutex>
 #include <thread>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <vector>
 #include <functional>
 #include <chrono>
 #include <string>
  
 struct Employee {
     Employee(std::string id) : id(id) {}
     std::string id;
     std::vector<std::string> lunch_partners;
     std::mutex m;
     std::string output() const
     {
         std::string ret = "Employee " + id + " has lunch partners: ";
         for( const auto& partner : lunch_partners )
             ret += partner + " ";
         return ret;
     }
 };
  
 void send_mail(Employee &, Employee &)
 {
     // simulate a time-consuming messaging operation
     std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
 }
  
 void assign_lunch_partner(Employee &e1, Employee &e2)
 {
     static std::mutex io_mutex;
     {
         std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lk(io_mutex);
         std::cout << e1.id << " and " << e2.id << " are waiting for locks" << std::endl;
     }
  
     {
         // use std::scoped_lock to acquire two locks without worrying about
         // other calls to assign_lunch_partner deadlocking us
         // and it also provides a convenient RAII-style mechanism
  
         std::scoped_lock lock(e1.m, e2.m);
  
         // Equivalent code 1 (using std::lock and std::lock_guard)
         // std::lock(e1.m, e2.m);
         // std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lk1(e1.m, std::adopt_lock);
         // std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lk2(e2.m, std::adopt_lock);
  
         // Equivalent code 2 (if unique_locks are needed, e.g. for condition variables)
         // std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lk1(e1.m, std::defer_lock);
         // std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lk2(e2.m, std::defer_lock);
         // std::lock(lk1, lk2);
         {
             std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lk(io_mutex);
             std::cout << e1.id << " and " << e2.id << " got locks" << std::endl;
         }
         e1.lunch_partners.push_back(e2.id);
         e2.lunch_partners.push_back(e1.id);
     }
  
     send_mail(e1, e2);
     send_mail(e2, e1);
 }
  
 int main()
 {
     Employee alice("alice"), bob("bob"), christina("christina"), dave("dave");
  
     // assign in parallel threads because mailing users about lunch assignments
     // takes a long time
     std::vector<std::thread> threads;
     threads.emplace_back(assign_lunch_partner, std::ref(alice), std::ref(bob));
     threads.emplace_back(assign_lunch_partner, std::ref(christina), std::ref(bob));
     threads.emplace_back(assign_lunch_partner, std::ref(christina), std::ref(alice));
     threads.emplace_back(assign_lunch_partner, std::ref(dave), std::ref(bob));
  
     for (auto &thread : threads) thread.join();
     std::cout << alice.output() << '\\n'  << bob.output() << '\\n'
               << christina.output() << '\\n' << dave.output() << '\\n';
 }

.SH Possible output:

 alice and bob are waiting for locks
 alice and bob got locks
 christina and bob are waiting for locks
 christina and alice are waiting for locks
 dave and bob are waiting for locks
 dave and bob got locks
 christina and alice got locks
 christina and bob got locks
 Employee alice has lunch partners: bob christina
 Employee bob has lunch partners: alice dave christina
 Employee christina has lunch partners: alice bob
 Employee dave has lunch partners: bob
