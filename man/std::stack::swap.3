.SH NAME
std::stack::swap \- std::stack::swap

.SH Synopsis
   void swap( stack& other ) noexcept(/* see below */);  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Exchanges the contents of the container adaptor with those of other. Effectively
   calls using std::swap; swap(c, other.c);

.SH Parameters

   other - container adaptor to exchange the contents with

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Exceptions

   noexcept specification:
   noexcept(noexcept(swap(c, other.c)))                                   \fI(since C++11)\fP
                                                                          \fI(until C++17)\fP
   In the expression above, the identifier swap is looked up in the same
   manner as the one used by the C++17 std::is_nothrow_swappable trait.
   noexcept specification:                                                \fI(since C++17)\fP
   noexcept(std::is_nothrow_swappable_v<Container>)

.SH Complexity

   Same as underlying container (typically constant).

.SH Notes

   Some implementations (e.g. libc++) provide the swap member function as an extension
   to pre-C++11 modes.

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <stack>
 #include <string>
 #include <vector>

 template <typename Stack>
 void print(Stack stack /* pass by value */, int id)
 {
     std::cout << "s" << id << " [" << stack.size() << "]: ";
     for (; !stack.empty(); stack.pop())
         std::cout << stack.top() << ' ';
     std::cout << (id > 1 ? "\\n\\n" : "\\n");
 }

 int main()
 {
     std::vector<std::string>
         v1{"1","2","3","4"},
         v2{"Ɐ","B","Ɔ","D","Ǝ"};

     std::stack s1{std::move(v1)};
     std::stack s2{std::move(v2)};

     print(s1, 1);
     print(s2, 2);

     s1.swap(s2);

     print(s1, 1);
     print(s2, 2);
 }

.SH Output:

 s1 [4]: 4 3 2 1
 s2 [5]: Ǝ D Ɔ B Ɐ

 s1 [5]: Ǝ D Ɔ B Ɐ
 s2 [4]: 4 3 2 1
