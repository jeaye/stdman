.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <vector>
   template<

   class T,                                                      \fB(1)\fP
   class Allocator = std::allocator<T>

   > class vector;
   namespace pmr {

   template <class T>                                            \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   using vector = std::vector<T, std::polymorphic_allocator<T>>;

   }

   1) std::vector is a sequence container that encapsulates dynamic size arrays.
   2) std::pmr::vector is an alias template that uses a polymorphic allocator

   The elements are stored contiguously, which means that elements can be
   accessed not only through iterators, but also using offsets on regular
   pointers to elements. This means that a pointer to an element of a     (since C++03)
   vector may be passed to any function that expects a pointer to an
   element of an array.

   The storage of the vector is handled automatically, being expanded and contracted as
   needed. Vectors usually occupy more space than static arrays, because more memory is
   allocated to handle future growth. This way a vector does not need to reallocate
   each time an element is inserted, but only when the additional memory is exhausted.
   The total amount of allocated memory can be queried using capacity() function.
   Extra memory can be returned to the system via a call to shrink_to_fit().
   \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Reallocations are usually costly operations in terms of performance. reserve()
   function can be used to eliminate reallocations if the number of elements is known
   beforehand.

   The complexity (efficiency) of common operations on vectors is as follows:

     * Random access - constant O(1)
     * Insertion or removal of elements at the end - amortized constant O(1)
     * Insertion or removal of elements - linear in distance to the end of the vector
       O(n)

   std::vector meets the requirements of Container, AllocatorAwareContainer,
   SequenceContainer
   , ContiguousContainer (for T other than bool)
   \fI(since C++17)\fP and ReversibleContainer.

.SH Template parameters

               The type of the elements.

               T must meet the requirements of CopyAssignable and         \fI(until C++11)\fP
               CopyConstructible.
               The requirements that are imposed on the elements depend
               on the actual operations performed on the container.       \fI(since C++11)\fP
               Generally, it is required that element type is a complete  \fI(until C++17)\fP
               type and meets the requirements of Erasable, but many
   T         - member functions impose stricter requirements.
               The requirements that are imposed on the elements depend
               on the actual operations performed on the container.
               Generally, it is required that element type meets the
               requirements of Erasable, but many member functions impose \fI(since C++17)\fP
               stricter requirements. This container (but not its
               members) can be instantiated with an incomplete element
               type if the allocator satisfies the allocator completeness
               requirements.
               An allocator that is used to acquire memory to store the elements. The
   Allocator - type must meet the requirements of Allocator. The behavior is undefined
               if Allocator::value_type is not the same as T.

.SH Specializations

   The standard library provides a specialization of std::vector for the type bool,
   which is optimized for space efficiency.

   vector<bool> space-efficient dynamic bitset
