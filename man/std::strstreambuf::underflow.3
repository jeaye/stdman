.SH NAME
std::strstreambuf::underflow \- std::strstreambuf::underflow

.SH Synopsis
   protected:
   virtual streambuf<char>* setbuf(char* s, std::streamsize n);

   If s is a null pointer and n is zero, this function has no effect.

   Otherwise, the effect is implementation-defined: some implementations do nothing,
   while some implementations deallocate the dynamic member array used as the buffer
   and begin using the user-supplied character array of size n, whose first element is
   pointed to by s.

   This function is protected virtual, it may only be called through pubsetbuf() or
   from member functions of a user-defined class derived from std::strstreambuf.

.SH Parameters

   s - pointer to the first byte in the user-provided buffer
   n - the number of bytes in the user-provided buffer

.SH Return value

   this

.SH Example

   Implementation test to check if setbuf() is supported on a dynamic strstream (output
   obtained with Sun Studio)

   
// Run this code

 #include <strstream>
 #include <iostream>
  
 int main()
 {
     char a[100] = {};
     std::strstream str;
     str.rdbuf()->pubsetbuf(a, sizeof a);
     str << "Test string" << std::ends;
     std::cout << "user-provided buffer holds '" << a << "'\\n";
 }

.SH Possible output:

 user-provided buffer holds 'Test string'
