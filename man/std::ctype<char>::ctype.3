.SH NAME
std::ctype<char>::ctype \- std::ctype<char>::ctype

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <locale>
   explicit ctype( const mask* tbl = 0, bool del = false, std::size_t refs = 0);

   Creates a std::ctype<char> facet and forwards the starting reference count refs to
   the base class constructor, locale::facet::facet().

   If tbl is null, classic_table() is used by all classification member functions.
   Otherwise, tbl must be a pointer to the first element of an array of masks, at least
   std::ctype<char>::table_size in size, and that array is used by all of this facet's
   classification member functions.

   If del is true, it is assumed that the array was allocated with new[], and the
   destructor of this facet will call delete[] tbl

.SH Parameters

   tbl  - classification table to use or a null pointer
   del  - indicator whether the table needs to be deleted.
   refs - starting reference count
