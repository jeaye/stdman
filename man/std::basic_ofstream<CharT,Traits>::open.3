.SH Synopsis
   void open( const char *filename,                              \fB(1)\fP
   ios_base::openmode mode = ios_base::out );
   void open( const std::filesystem::path::value_type *filename, \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   ios_base::openmode mode = ios_base::out );
   void open( const std::string &filename,                       \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   ios_base::openmode mode = ios_base::out );
   void open( const std::filesystem::path &filename,             \fB(4)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   ios_base::openmode mode = ios_base::out );

   Opens and associates the file with name filename with the file stream.

   Calls setstate(failbit) on failure.

   Calls clear() on success. \fI(since C++11)\fP

   1-2) Effectively calls rdbuf()->open(filename, mode | ios_base::out). (see
   std::basic_filebuf::open for the details on the effects of that call).
   Overload \fB(2)\fP is only provided if std::filesystem::path::value_type is not char.
   \fI(since C++17)\fP
   3-4) Effectively calls (1-2) as if by open(filename.c_str(), mode).

.SH Parameters

   filename - the name of the file to be opened
              specifies stream open mode. It is bitmask type, the following constants
              are defined:

              Constant Explanation
   mode     - app      seek to the end of stream before each write
              binary   open in binary mode
              in       open for reading
              out      open for writing
              trunc    discard the contents of the stream when opening
              ate      seek to the end of stream immediately after open

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP
