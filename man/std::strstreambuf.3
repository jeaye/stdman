std::strstreambuf \- std::strstreambuf

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <strstream>
   class strstreambuf : public std::basic_streambuf<char>  (deprecated in C++98)

   std::strstreambuf is a std::basic_streambuf whose associated character sequence is a
   character array, which may be constant (e.g. a string literal), modifyable but not
   dynamic (e.g. a stack-allocated array), or dynamic, in which case the
   std::strstreambuf may be allowed to reallocate the array as necessary to accomodate
   output (e.g. by calling delete[] and new[] or user-provided functions).

   Typical implementation of a std::strstreambuf holds four private data members:

   1) buffer state, a bitmask type which can represent any combination of the four
   values "allocated" (destructor will deallocate), "constant" (output not allowed),
   "dynamic" (output may reallocate), or "frozen" (deallocation and reallocation are
   not allowed)
   2) allocated buffer size (the beginning of the buffer does not need a special data
   member, it may be stored in the inherited pointer eback())
   3) pointer to user-provided allocation function
   4) pointer to user-provided deallocation function.

.SH Notes

   After any call to str() on a stream with a dynamic buffer, a call to freeze(false)
   is required to allow the strstreambuf destructor to deallocate the buffer when
   necessary.

.SH Member functions

.SH Public member functions
   constructor   constructs a strstreambuf object
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
   destructor    destructs a strstreambuf object, optionally deallocating the character
   \fB[virtual]\fP     array
                 \fI(virtual public member function)\fP
   freeze        sets/clears the frozen state of the buffer
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
                 marks the buffer frozen and returns the beginning pointer of the input
   str           sequence
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
                 returns the next pointer minus the beginning pointer in the output
   pcount        sequence: the number of characters written

   \fB[virtual]\fP     pointer

   pbackfail     backs out the input sequence to unget a character
   \fB[virtual]\fP     \fI(virtual protected member function)\fP
   overflow      appends a character to the output sequence, may reallocate or
   \fB[virtual]\fP     initially allocate the buffer if dynamic and not frozen
                 \fI(virtual protected member function)\fP
   setbuf        attempts to replace the controlled character sequence with an array
   \fB[virtual]\fP     \fI(virtual protected member function)\fP
   seekoff       repositions the next pointer in the input sequence, output sequence,
   \fB[virtual]\fP     or both, using relative addressing
                 \fI(virtual protected member function)\fP

   \fB[virtual]\fP     or both using absolute addressing
