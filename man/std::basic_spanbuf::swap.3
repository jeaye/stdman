std::basic_spanbuf::swap \- std::basic_spanbuf::swap

.SH Synopsis
   void swap( basic_spanbuf& rhs );  (since C++23)

   Swaps the state of *this and rhs.

   Calls std::basic_streambuf<Char, Traits>::swap(rhs), swaps the open mode of *this
   and rhs, and then makes them use the underlying buffer of each other.

.SH Parameters

   rhs - another basic_stringbuf

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Exceptions

   May throw implementation-defined exceptions.

.SH Notes

   This function is called automatically when swapping stream objects, it is rarely
   necessary to call it directly.
