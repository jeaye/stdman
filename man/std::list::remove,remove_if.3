   size_type remove_if( UnaryPredicate p );

   Removes all elements satisfying specific criteria. Invalidates only the iterators
   and references to the removed elements.

   1) Removes all elements that are equal to value (using operator==).
   2) Removes all elements for which predicate p returns true.

.SH Parameters

   value - value of the elements to remove
           unary predicate which returns true if the element should be removed.

           The expression p(v) must be convertible to bool for every argument v of type
   p     - (possibly const) T, regardless of value category, and must not modify v.
           Thus, a parameter type of T&is not allowed
           , nor is T unless for T a move is equivalent to a copy
           \fI(since C++11)\fP.
.SH Type requirements
   -
   UnaryPredicate must meet the requirements of Predicate.

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP                          \fI(until C++20)\fP
   The number of elements removed. \fI(since C++20)\fP

.SH Complexity

   Given \\(\\scriptsize N\\)N as std::distance(begin(), end()):

   1) Exactly \\(\\scriptsize N\\)N comparisons using operator==.
   2) Exactly \\(\\scriptsize N\\)N applications of the predicate p.

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <list>
 #include <iostream>

 int main()
 {
     std::list<int> l = {1, 100, 2, 3, 10, 1, 11, -1, 12};

     auto count1 = l.remove(1);
     std::cout << count1 << " elements equal to 1 were removed\\n";

     auto count2 = l.remove_if([](int n){ return n > 10; });
     std::cout << count2 << " elements greater than 10 were removed\\n";

     std::cout << "Finally, the list contains: ";
     for (int n : l)
         std::cout << n << ' ';
     std::cout << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 2 elements equal to 1 were removed
 3 elements greater than 10 were removed
 Finally, the list contains: 2 3 10 -1

  Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to
   previously published C++ standards.

      DR    Applied to       Behavior as published              Correct behavior
                       it was unclear whether iterators  only invalidates iterators and
   LWG 1207 C++98      and/or references will be         references to the removed
                       invalidated                       elements
