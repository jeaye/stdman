.TH std::basic_stringbuf::setbuf 3 "Nov 16 2016" "2.1 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::basic_stringbuf::setbuf \- std::basic_stringbuf::setbuf

.SH Synopsis
   protected:
   virtual std::basic_streambuf<CharT, Traits>* setbuf( char_type* s, std::streamsize
   n )

   If s is a null pointer and n is zero, this function has no effect.

   Otherwise, the effect is implementation-defined: some implementations do nothing,
   while some implementations clear the std::string member currently used as the buffer
   and begin using the user-supplied character array of size n, whose first element is
   pointed to by s, as the buffer and the input/output character sequence.

   This function is protected virtual, it may only be called through pubsetbuf() or
   from member functions of a user-defined class derived from std::basic_stringbuf.

.SH Parameters

   s - pointer to the first byte in the user-provided buffer or null
   n - the number of bytes in the user-provided buffer or zero

.SH Return value

   this.

.SH Notes

   The deprecated stream buffer std::strstreambuf or the boost.IOStreams device
   boost::basic_array may be used to implement I/O buffering over a user-provided char
   array in portable manner.

.SH Example

   Test for the stringstream's setbuf functionality

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <sstream>

 int main()
 {
     std::ostringstream ss;
     char c[1024] = {};
     ss.rdbuf()->pubsetbuf(c, 1024);
     ss << 3.14 << '\\n';
     std::cout << c << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 3.14 (on GNU g++/libstdc++ and SunPro C++/roguewave)
 <nothing> (on MS Visual Studio 2010, SunPro C++/stlport4, CLang++/libc++)
