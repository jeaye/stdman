   getline reads characters from an input stream and places them into a string:

   1) Behaves as UnformattedInputFunction, except that input.gcount() is not affected.
   After constructing and checking the sentry object, performs the following:
   1) Calls str.erase()
   2) Extracts characters from input and appends them to str until one of the following
   occurs (checked in the order listed)
   a) end-of-file condition on input, in which case, getline sets eofbit and returns.
   b) the next available input character is delim, as tested by Traits::eq(c, delim),
   in which case the delimiter character is extracted from input, but is not appended
   to str.
   c) str.max_size() characters have been stored, in which case getline sets failbit
   and returns.
   3) If no characters were extracted for whatever reason (not even the discarded
   delimiter), getline sets failbit and returns.
   2) Same as getline(input, str, input.widen(’\\n’)), that is, the default delimiter is
   the endline character.

.SH Parameters

   input - the stream to get data from
   str   - the string to put the data into
   delim - the delimiter character

.SH Return value

   input

.SH Notes

   When used immediately after whitespace-delimited input, e.g. after int n; std::cin
   >> n;, getline consumes the endline character left on the input stream by
   operator>>, and returns immediately. A common solution is to ignore all leftover
   characters on the line of input with
   cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits<std::streamsize>::max(), '\\n'); before switching to
   line-oriented input.

.SH Example

   The following example demonstrates how to use getline function to read user's input
   and how to process file line by line.

   
// Run this code

 #include <string>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <sstream>

 int main()
 {
     // greet the user
     std::string name;
     std::cout << "What is your name? ";
     std::getline(std::cin, name);
     std::cout << "Hello " << name << ", nice to meet you.\\n";

     // read file line by line
     std::istringstream input;
     input.str("1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n");
     int sum = 0;
     for (std::string line; std::getline(input, line); ) {
         sum += std::stoi(line);
     }
     std::cout << "\\nThe sum is: " << sum << "\\n";
 }

.SH Possible output:

 What is your name? John Q. Public
 Hello John Q. Public, nice to meet you.

 The sum is 28
