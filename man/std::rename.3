.TH std::rename 3 "2021.11.17" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::rename \- std::rename

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstdio>
   int rename( const char *old_filename, const char *new_filename );

   Changes the filename of a file. The file is identified by character string pointed
   to by old_filename. The new filename is identified by character string pointed to by
   new_filename.

   If new_filename exists, the behavior is implementation-defined.

.SH Parameters

   old_filename - pointer to a null-terminated string containing the path identifying
                  the file to rename
   new_filename - pointer to a null-terminated string containing the new path of the
                  file

.SH Return value

   0 upon success or non-zero value on error.

.SH Notes

   POSIX specifies many additional details on the semantics of this function, which are
   reproduced in C++ by std::filesystem::rename.

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <fstream>
 #include <cstdio>
 int main()
 {
     bool ok{std::ofstream("from.txt").put('a')}; // create and write to file
     if (!ok) {
         std::perror("Error creating from.txt");
         return 1;
     }

     if (std::rename("from.txt", "to.txt")) {
         std::perror("Error renaming");
         return 1;
     }

     std::cout << std::ifstream("to.txt").rdbuf() << '\\n'; // print file
