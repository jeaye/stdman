.SH NAME
std::rename \- std::rename

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstdio>
   int rename( const char *old_filename, const char *new_filename );

   Changes the filename of a file. The file is identified by character string pointed
   to by old_filename. The new filename is identified by character string pointed to by
   new_filename.

   If new_filename exists, the behavior is implementation-defined.

.SH Parameters

   old_filename - pointer to a null-terminated string containing the path identifying
                  the file to rename
   new_filename - pointer to a null-terminated string containing the new path of the
                  file

.SH Return value

   0 upon success or non-zero value on error.

.SH Notes

   POSIX specifies many additional details on the semantics of this function, which are
   reproduced in C++ by std::experimental::filesystem::rename.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <fstream>
 #include <cstdio>
 int main()
 {
     bool ok = std::ofstream("from.txt").put('a'); // create and write to file
     if(!ok) { std::perror("Error creating from.txt"); return 1; }
  
     int rc = std::rename("from.txt", "to.txt");
     if(rc) { std::perror("Error renaming"); return 1; }
  
     std::cout << std::ifstream("to.txt").rdbuf() << '\\n'; // print file
 }
