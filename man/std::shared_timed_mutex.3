std::shared_timed_mutex \- std::shared_timed_mutex

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <shared_mutex>
   class shared_timed_mutex;         \fI(since C++14)\fP

   The shared_timed_mutex class is a synchronization primitive that can be used to
   protect shared data from being simultaneously accessed by multiple threads. In
   contrast to other mutex types which facilitate exclusive access, a
   shared_timed_mutex has two levels of access:

     * exclusive - only one thread can own the mutex.

     * shared - several threads can share ownership of the same mutex.

   Shared mutexes are usually used in situations when multiple readers can access the
   same resource at the same time without causing data races, but only one writer can
   do so.

   In a manner similar to timed_mutex, shared_timed_mutex provides the ability to
   attempt to claim ownership of a shared_timed_mutex with a timeout via the
   try_lock_for(), try_lock_until(), try_lock_shared_for(), try_lock_shared_until()
   member functions.

   The shared_timed_mutex class satisfies all requirements of SharedTimedMutex and
   StandardLayoutType.

.SH Example

    This section is incomplete
    Reason: build a motivating example

   A copy assignment operator for a class that holds resources that can handle multiple
   readers, but only one writer


// Run this code

 #include <mutex>
 #include <shared_mutex>

 class R
 {
     mutable std::shared_timed_mutex mut;
     /* data */
 public:
     R& operator=(const R& other)
     {
         // requires exclusive ownership to write to *this
         std::unique_lock<std::shared_timed_mutex> lhs(mut, std::defer_lock);
         // requires shared ownership to read from other
         std::shared_lock<std::shared_timed_mutex> rhs(other.mut, std::defer_lock);
         std::lock(lhs, rhs);
         /* assign data */
         return *this;
     }
 };

 int main() {
     R r;
 }
