.SH NAME
std::future::wait_until \- std::future::wait_until

.SH Synopsis
   template< class Clock, class Duration >
   std::future_status wait_until( const                                   \fI(since C++11)\fP
   std::chrono::time_point<Clock,Duration>& timeout_time ) const;

   wait_until waits for a result to become available. It blocks until specified
   timeout_time has been reached or the result becomes available, whichever comes
   first. The return value indicates why wait_until returned.

   The behavior is undefined if valid()== false before the call to this function.

.SH Parameters

   timeout_time - maximum time point to block until

.SH Return value

   Constant                Explanation
   future_status::deferred The function to calculate the result has not been started
                           yet
   future_status::ready    The result is ready
   future_status::timeout  The timeout has expired

.SH Exceptions

   Any exception thrown by clock, time_point, or duration during the execution (clocks,
   time points, and durations provided by the standard library never throw)

.SH Notes

   The implementations are encouraged to detect the case when valid == false before the
   call and throw a future_error with an error condition of future_errc::no_state.

   The clock tied to timeout_time is used, which is not required to be a monotonic
   clock.There are no guarantees regarding the behavior of this function if the clock
   is adjusted discontinuously, but the existing implementations convert timeout_time
   from Clock to std::chrono::system_clock and delegate to POSIX pthread_cond_timedwait
   so that the wait honors ajustments to the system clock, but not to the the
   user-provided Clock. In any case, the function also may wait for longer than until
   after timeout_time has been reached due to scheduling or resource contention delays.
