.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <mutex>
   class recursive_mutex;     \fI(since C++11)\fP

   The recursive_mutex class is a synchronization primitive that can be used to protect
   shared data from being simultaneously accessed by multiple threads.

   recursive_mutex offers exclusive, recursive ownership semantics:

     * A calling thread owns a recursive_mutex for a period of time that starts when it
       successfully calls either lock or try_lock. During this period, the thread may
       make additional calls to lock or try_lock. The period of ownership ends when the
       thread makes a matching number of calls to unlock.
     * When a thread owns a recursive_mutex, all other threads will block (for calls to
       lock) or receive a false return value (for try_lock) if they attempt to claim
       ownership of the recursive_mutex.
     * The maximum number of times that a recursive_mutex may be locked is unspecified,
       but after that number is reached, calls to lock will throw std::system_error and
       calls to try_lock will return false.

   The behavior of a program is undefined if a recursive_mutex is destroyed while still
   owned by some thread. The recursive_mutex class satisfies all requirements of Mutex
   and StandardLayoutType.
