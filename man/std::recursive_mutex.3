.SH NAME
std::recursive_mutex \- std::recursive_mutex

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <mutex>
   class recursive_mutex;     \fI(since C++11)\fP

   The recursive_mutex class is a synchronization primitive that can be used to protect
   shared data from being simultaneously accessed by multiple threads.

   recursive_mutex offers exclusive, recursive ownership semantics:

     * A calling thread owns a recursive_mutex for a period of time that starts when it
       successfully calls either lock or try_lock. During this period, the thread may
       make additional calls to lock or try_lock. The period of ownership ends when the
       thread makes a matching number of calls to unlock.
     * When a thread owns a recursive_mutex, all other threads will block (for calls to
       lock) or receive a false return value (for try_lock) if they attempt to claim
       ownership of the recursive_mutex.
     * The maximum number of times that a recursive_mutex may be locked is unspecified,
       but after that number is reached, calls to lock will throw std::system_error and
       calls to try_lock will return false.

   The behavior of a program is undefined if a recursive_mutex is destroyed while still
   owned by some thread. The recursive_mutex class satisfies all requirements of Mutex
   and StandardLayoutType.

.SH Member functions

   constructor   constructs the mutex
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
   destructor    destroys the mutex
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
   operator=     not copy-assignable
   [deleted]     \fI(public member function)\fP
.SH Locking
   lock          locks the mutex, blocks if the mutex is not available
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
   try_lock      tries to lock the mutex, returns if the mutex is not available
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
   unlock        unlocks the mutex
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
.SH Native handle
   native_handle returns the underlying implementation-defined native handle object
                 \fI(public member function)\fP

.SH Example

   one use case for recursive_mutex is protecting shared state in a class whose member
   functions may call each other


// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <thread>
 #include <mutex>

 class X {
     std::recursive_mutex m;
     std::string shared;
   public:
     void fun1() {
       std::lock_guard<std::recursive_mutex> lk(m);
       shared = "fun1";
       std::cout << "in fun1, shared variable is now " << shared << '\\n';
     }
     void fun2() {
       std::lock_guard<std::recursive_mutex> lk(m);
       shared = "fun2";
       std::cout << "in fun2, shared variable is now " << shared << '\\n';
       fun1(); // recursive lock becomes useful here
       std::cout << "back in fun2, shared variable is " << shared << '\\n';
     };
 };

 int main()
 {
     X x;
     std::thread t1(&X::fun1, &x);
     std::thread t2(&X::fun2, &x);
     t1.join();
     t2.join();
 }

.SH Possible output:

 in fun1, shared variable is now fun1
 in fun2, shared variable is now fun2
 in fun1, shared variable is now fun1
 back in fun2, shared variable is fun1
