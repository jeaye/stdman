.SH NAME
std::notify_all_at_thread_exit \- std::notify_all_at_thread_exit

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <condition_variable>
   void notify_all_at_thread_exit( std::condition_variable& cond,  \fI(since C++11)\fP
   std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lk );

   notify_all_at_thread_exit provides a mechanism to notify other threads that a given
   thread has completely finished, including destroying all thread_local objects. It
   operates as follows:

     * Ownership of the previously acquired lock lk is transferred to internal storage.

     * The execution environment is modified such that when the current thread exits,
       the condition variable cond is notified as if by:

   lk.unlock();
   cond.notify_all();

   The implied lk.unlock is sequenced after (as defined in std::memory_order) the
   destruction of all objects with thread local storage duration associated with the
   current thread.

   An equivalent effect may be achieved with the facilities provided by std::promise or
   std::packaged_task.

.SH Notes

   Calling this function if lock.mutex() is not locked by the current thread is
   undefined behavior.

   Calling this function if lock.mutex() is not the same mutex as the one used by all
   other threads that are currently waiting on the same condition variable is undefined
   behavior.

   The supplied lock lk is held until the thread exits. Once this function has been
   called, no more threads may acquire the same lock in order to wait on cond. If some
   thread is waiting on this condition variable, it should not attempt to release and
   reacquire the lock when it wakes up spuriously.

   In typical use cases, this function is the last thing called by a detached thread.

.SH Parameters

   cond - the condition variable to notify at thread exit
   lk   - the lock associated with the condition variable cond

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Example

   This partial code fragment illustrates how notify_all_at_thread_exit can be used to
   avoid accessing data that depends on thread locals while those thread locals are in
   the process of being destructed:

   
// Run this code

 #include <mutex>
 #include <thread>
 #include <condition_variable>

 std::mutex m;
 std::condition_variable cv;

 bool ready = false;
 ComplexType result;  // some arbitrary type

 void thread_func()
 {
     std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lk(m);
     // assign a value to result using thread_local data
     result = function_that_uses_thread_locals();
     ready = true;
     std::notify_all_at_thread_exit(cv, std::move(lk));
 } // 1. destroy thread_locals, 2. unlock mutex, 3. notify cv

 int main()
 {
     std::thread t(thread_func);
     t.detach();

     // do other work
     // ...

     // wait for the detached thread
     std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lk(m);
     while(!ready) {
         cv.wait(lk);
     }
     process(result); // result is ready and thread_local destructors have finished
 }
