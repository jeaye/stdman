std::vector<bool> \- std::vector<bool>

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <vector>
   template<class Allocator>
   class vector<bool, Allocator>;

   std::vector<bool> is a possibly space-efficient specialization of std::vector for
   the type bool.

   The manner in which std::vector<bool> is made space efficient (as well as whether it
   is optimized at all) is implementation defined. One potential optimization involves
   coalescing vector elements such that each element occupies a single bit instead of
   sizeof(bool) bytes.

   std::vector<bool> behaves similarly to std::vector, but in order to be space
   efficient, it:

     * Does not necessarily store its elements as a contiguous array (so &v[0] + n !=
       &v[n])
     * Exposes class std::vector<bool>::reference as a method of accessing individual
       bits. In particular, objects of this class are returned by operator[] by value.
     * Does not use std::allocator_traits::construct to construct bit values.
     * Does not guarantee that different elements in the same container can be modified
       concurrently by different threads.

.SH Notes

   If the size of the bitset is known at compile time, std::bitset may be used, which
   offers a richer set of member functions. In addition, boost::dynamic_bitset exists
   as an alternative to std::vector<bool>.

   Since its representation may by optimized, std::vector<bool> does not necessarily
   meet all Container or SequenceContainer requirements. For example, because
   std::vector<bool>::iterator is implementation-defined, it may not satisfy the
   LegacyForwardIterator requirement. Use of algorithms such as std::search that
   require LegacyForwardIterators may result in either compile-time or run-time errors.

   The Boost.Container version of vector does not specialize for bool.
