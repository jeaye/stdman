   enum class future_status {

   };

   Specifies state of a future as returned by wait_for and wait_until functions of
   std::future and std::shared_future.

   Constant Explanation
   deferred the shared state contains a deferred function, so the result will be
            computed only when explicitly requested
   ready    the shared state is ready
   timeout  the shared state did not become ready before specified timeout duration has
            passed
