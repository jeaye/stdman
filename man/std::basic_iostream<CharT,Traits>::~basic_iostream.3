std::basic_iostream<CharT,Traits>::~basic_iostream \- std::basic_iostream<CharT,Traits>::~basic_iostream

.SH Synopsis
   virtual ~basic_iostream();

   Destructs the input/output stream.

.SH Notes

   This destructor does not perform any operation on the underlying stream buffer
   (rdbuf()): the destructors of the derived streams such as std::basic_fstream and
   std::basic_stringstream are responsible for calling the destructors of the stream
   buffers.
