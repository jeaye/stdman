.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <functional>
   template<class R, class... ArgTypes>                     \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   function(R(*)(ArgTypes...)) -> function<R(ArgTypes...)>;
   template<class F>                                        \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   function(F) -> function</*see below*/>;

   1) This deduction guide is provided for std::function to allow deduction from
   functions.
   2) This overload only participates in overload resolution if &F::operator() is
   well-formed when treated as an unevaluated operand and decltype(&F::operator()) is
   of the form R(G::*)(A...) (optionally cv-qualified, optionally noexcept, optionally
   lvalue reference qualified) for some class type G. The deduced type is
   std::function<R(A...)>.

.SH Notes

   The type deduced by these deduction guides may change in a later standard revision
   (in particular, this might happen if noexcept support is added to std::function in a
   later standard).

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <functional>
 int func(double) { return 0; }
 int main() {
   std::function f{func}; // guide #1 deduces function<int(double)>
   int i = 5;
   std::function g = [&](double) { return i; }; // guide #2 deduces function<int(double)>
 }
