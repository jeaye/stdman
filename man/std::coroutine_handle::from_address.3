.SH NAME
std::coroutine_handle::from_address \- std::coroutine_handle::from_address

.SH Synopsis
   static constexpr coroutine_handle from_address( void *addr );  \fI(since C++20)\fP

   Creates a coroutine_handle from a null pointer value or an underlying address of
   another coroutine_handle. The underlying address of return value is addr.

   The behavior is undefined if addr is neither a null pointer value nor an underlying
   address of a coroutine_handle.

   This function is not declared for specialization
   std::coroutine_handle<std::noop_coroutine_promise>.

.SH Parameters

   addr - underlying address to import

.SH Return values

   A std::coroutine_handle<Promise> whose underlying address is addr.

.SH Notes

   If addr is not a null pointer value, it must be obtained from a prior call to
   address() on a coroutine_handle referring to some coroutine.
