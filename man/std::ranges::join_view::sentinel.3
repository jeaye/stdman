.SH NAME
std::ranges::join_view::sentinel \- std::ranges::join_view::sentinel

.SH Synopsis
   template< bool Const >  \fI(since C++20)\fP
   class /*sentinel*/      (exposition only*)

   The return type of join_view::end when either of the underlying ranges (V or
   ranges::range_reference_t<V>) is not a common_range, or when the parent join_view is
   not a forward_range.

   If V is not a simple view, Const is true for sentinels returned from the const
   overloads, and false otherwise. If V is a simple view, Const is true.

.SH Member types

   Member type      Definition
                    const ranges::join_view<V> if Const is true, otherwise
   Parent (private) ranges::join_view<V>
                    (exposition-only member type*)
   Base (private)   const V if Const is true, otherwise V
                    (exposition-only member type*)

   Data members

   Member object  Definition
                  A sentinel of type std::sentinel_t<Base> obtained from (possibly
   end_ (private) const-qualified) V.
                  (exposition-only member object*)
