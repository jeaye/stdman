.SH Synopsis
   constexpr size_type find(basic_string_view v, size_type pos = 0)   \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   const;
   constexpr size_type find(CharT c, size_type pos = 0) const;        \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   constexpr size_type find(const CharT* s, size_type pos, size_type  \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   count) const;
   constexpr size_type find(const CharT* s, size_type pos = 0) const; \fB(4)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP

   Finds the first substring equal to the given character sequence.

   1) Finds the first occurence of v in this view, starting at position pos.
   2) Equivalent to find(basic_string_view(&c, 1), pos).
   3) Equivalent to find(basic_string_view(s, count), pos).
   4) Equivalent to find(basic_string_view(s), pos).

.SH Parameters

   v     - view to search for
   pos   - position at which to start the search
   count - length of substring to search for
   s     - pointer to a character string to search for
   ch    - character to search for

.SH Return value

   Position of the first character of the found substring, or npos if no such substring
   is found.

.SH Exceptions

   1-2)
   noexcept specification:
   noexcept

.SH Complexity

   O(size() * v.size()) at worst.
