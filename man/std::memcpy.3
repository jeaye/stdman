.TH std::memcpy 3 "2018.03.28" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::memcpy \- std::memcpy

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstring>
   void* memcpy( void* dest, const void* src, std::size_t count );

   Copies count bytes from the object pointed to by src to the object pointed to by
   dest. Both objects are reinterpreted as arrays of unsigned char.

   If the objects overlap, the behavior is undefined.

   If either dest or src is a null pointer, the behavior is undefined, even if count is
   zero.

   If the objects are not TriviallyCopyable, the behavior of memcpy is not specified
   and may be undefined.

.SH Parameters

   dest  - pointer to the memory location to copy to
   src   - pointer to the memory location to copy from
   count - number of bytes to copy

.SH Return value

   dest

.SH Notes

   std::memcpy is meant to be the fastest library routine for memory-to-memory copy. It
   is usually more efficient than std::strcpy, which must scan the data it copies or
   std::memmove, which must take precautions to handle overlapping inputs.

   Several C++ compilers transform suitable memory-copying loops to std::memcpy calls.

   Where strict aliasing prohibits examining the same memory as values of two different
   types, std::memcpy may be used to convert the values.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <cstdint>
 #include <cstring>
  
 int main()
 {
     // simple usage
     char source[] = "once upon a midnight dreary...", dest[4];
     std::memcpy(dest, source, sizeof dest);
     for (char c : dest)
         std::cout << c << '\\n';
  
     // reinterpreting
     double d = 0.1;
 //  std::int64_t n = *reinterpret_cast<std::int64_t*>(&d); // aliasing violation
     std::int64_t n;
     std::memcpy(&n, &d, sizeof d); // OK
  
     std::cout << std::hexfloat << d << " is " << std::hex << n
               << " as an std::int64_t\\n";
 }

.SH Output:

 0x1.999999999999ap-4 is 3fb999999999999a as an std::int64_t
