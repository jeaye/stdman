.SH NAME
std::basic_syncbuf::sync \- std::basic_syncbuf::sync

.SH Synopsis
   protected:
   int sync() override;

   First, records that a flush is pending, by updating the appropriate private flag.

   Then, if the current emit-on-sync policy is true, makes a call to emit().

   Otherwise (if the emit-on-sync policy is false, which is the default), the flush is
   suspended until emit() is called, such as through std::basic_osyncstream::emit() or
   std::basic_osyncstream::~basic_osyncstream

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Notes

   sync() or its equivalent is implicitly called by close(), seekoff(), and seekpos()
   and explicitly called by std::basic_streambuf::pubsync()

             calls emit() on the underlying basic_syncbuf to transmit its internal data
