.SH NAME
std::list::emplace \- std::list::emplace

.SH Synopsis
   template< class... Args >                                \fI(since C++11)\fP
   iterator emplace( const_iterator pos, Args&&... args );

   Inserts a new element into the container directly before pos. The element is
   constructed through std::allocator_traits::construct, which typically uses
   placement-new to construct the element in-place at a location provided by the
   container. The arguments args... are forwarded to the constructor as
   std::forward<Args>(args)....

   No iterators or references are invalidated.

.SH Parameters

   pos         -        iterator before which the new element will be constructed
   args        -        arguments to forward to the constructor of the element
.SH Type requirements
   -
   T (the container's element type) must meet the requirements of EmplaceConstructible.

.SH Return value

   Iterator pointing to the emplaced element.

.SH Complexity

   Constant.

.SH Exceptions

   If an exception is thrown (e.g. by the constructor), the container is left
   unmodified, as if this function was never called \fI(strong exception guarantee)\fP.
