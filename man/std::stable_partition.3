.SH NAME
std::stable_partition \- std::stable_partition

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <algorithm>
   template< class BidirIt, class UnaryPredicate >
   BidirIt stable_partition( BidirIt first, BidirIt last,             \fB(1)\fP
   UnaryPredicate p );
   template< class ExecutionPolicy, class BidirIt, class
   UnaryPredicate >                                                   \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   BidirIt stable_partition( ExecutionPolicy&& policy, BidirIt first,
   BidirIt last, UnaryPredicate p );

   1) Reorders the elements in the range [first, last) in such a way that all elements
   for which the predicate p returns true precede the elements for which predicate p
   returns false. Relative order of the elements is preserved.
   2) Same as \fB(1)\fP, but executed according to policy. This overload only participates in
   overload resolution if std::is_execution_policy_v<std::decay_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is
   true.

.SH Parameters

   first, last -  the range of elements to reorder
   policy      -  the execution policy to use. See execution policy for details.
                  unary predicate which returnstrue if the element should be ordered
                  before other elements.

                  The expression p(v) must be convertible to bool for every argument v
   p           -  of type (possibly const) VT, where VT is the value type of BidirIt,
                  regardless of value category, and must not modify v. Thus, a
                  parameter type of VT&is not allowed
                  , nor is VT unless for VT a move is equivalent to a copy
                  \fI(since C++11)\fP.
.SH Type requirements
   -
   BidirIt must meet the requirements of ValueSwappable and
   LegacyBidirectionalIterator.
   -
   The type of dereferenced BidirIt must meet the requirements of MoveAssignable and
   MoveConstructible.
   -
   UnaryPredicate must meet the requirements of Predicate.

.SH Return value

   Iterator to the first element of the second group

.SH Complexity

   Given N = last - first

   1) Exactly N applications of the predicate and O(N) swaps if there is enough extra
   memory. If memory is insufficient, at most N log N swaps.
   2) O(N log N) swaps and O(N) applications of the predicate

.SH Exceptions

   The overload with a template parameter named ExecutionPolicy reports errors as
   follows:

     * If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws an exception
       and ExecutionPolicy is one of the standard policies, std::terminate is called.
       For any other ExecutionPolicy, the behavior is implementation-defined.
     * If the algorithm fails to allocate memory, std::bad_alloc is thrown.

.SH Notes

   This function attempts to allocate a temporary buffer. If the allocation fails, the
   less efficient algorithm is chosen.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <algorithm>
 #include <vector>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::vector<int> v{0, 0, 3, 0, 2, 4, 5, 0, 7};
     std::stable_partition(v.begin(), v.end(), [](int n){return n>0;});
     for (int n : v) {
         std::cout << n << ' ';
     }
     std::cout << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 3 2 4 5 7 0 0 0 0
