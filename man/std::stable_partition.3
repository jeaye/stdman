.SH NAME
std::stable_partition \- std::stable_partition

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <algorithm>
   template< class BidirIt, class UnaryPredicate >
   BidirIt stable_partition( BidirIt first, BidirIt last,             \fB(1)\fP
   UnaryPredicate p );
   template< class ExecutionPolicy, class BidirIt, class
   UnaryPredicate >                                                   \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   BidirIt stable_partition( ExecutionPolicy&& policy, BidirIt first,
   BidirIt last, UnaryPredicate p );

   1) Reorders the elements in the range [first, last) in such a way that all elements
   for which the predicate p returns true precede the elements for which predicate p
   returns false. Relative order of the elements is preserved.
   2) Same as \fB(1)\fP, but executed according to policy. This overload does not participate
   in overload resolution unless
   std::is_execution_policy_v<std::decay_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true

.SH Parameters

   first, last - the range of elements to reorder
   policy      - the execution policy to use. See execution policy for details.
                 unary predicate which returns true if the element should be ordered
                 before other elements.

                 The signature of the predicate function should be equivalent to the
                 following:
   p           -
                  bool pred(const Type &a);

                 The signature does not need to have const &, but the function must not
                 modify the objects passed to it.
                 The type Type must be such that an object of type BidirIt can be
                 dereferenced and then implicitly converted to Type. 
.SH Type requirements
   -
   BidirIt must meet the requirements of ValueSwappable and BidirectionalIterator.
   -
   The type of dereferenced BidirIt must meet the requirements of MoveAssignable and
   MoveConstructible.
   -
   UnaryPredicate must meet the requirements of Predicate.

.SH Return value

   Iterator to the first element of the second group

.SH Complexity

   Exactly last-first applications of the predicate and at most
   (last-first)*log(last-first) swaps if there is insufficient memory or linear number
   of swaps if sufficient memory is available.

.SH Exceptions

   The overload with a template parameter named ExecutionPolicy reports errors as
   follows:

     * If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws an exception
       and ExecutionPolicy is one of the three standard policies, std::terminate is
       called. For any other ExecutionPolicy, the behavior is implementation-defined.
     * If the algorithm fails to allocate memory, std::bad_alloc is thrown.

.SH Notes

   This function attempts to allocate a temporary buffer, typically by calling
   std::get_temporary_buffer. If the allocation fails, the less efficient algorithm is
   chosen.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <algorithm>
 #include <vector>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::vector<int> v{0, 0, 3, 0, 2, 4, 5, 0, 7};
     std::stable_partition(v.begin(), v.end(), [](int n){return n>0;});
     for (int n : v) {
         std::cout << n << ' ';
     }
     std::cout << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 3 2 4 5 7 0 0 0 0
