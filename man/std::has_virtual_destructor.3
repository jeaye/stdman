.SH NAME
std::has_virtual_destructor \- std::has_virtual_destructor

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <type_traits>
   template< class T >              \fI(since C++11)\fP
   struct has_virtual_destructor;

   If T is a type with a virtual destructor, provides the member constant value equal
   true. For any other type, value is false.

.SH Member constants

   value    true if T has a virtual destructor , false otherwise
   \fB[static]\fP \fI(public static member constant)\fP

.SH Member functions

   operator bool converts the object to bool, returns value
                 \fI(public member function)\fP

.SH Member types

   Type       Definition
   value_type bool
   type       std::integral_constant<bool, value>

.SH Notes

   If a class has a public virtual destructor, it can be derived from, and the derived
   object can be safely deleted through a pointer to the base object (C++FAQ Lite 20.7)

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <type_traits>
 #include <string>
 #include <stdexcept>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::cout << std::boolalpha
               << "std::string has a virtual destructor? "
               << std::has_virtual_destructor<std::string>::value << '\\n'
               << "std::runtime_error has a virtual destructor? "
               << std::has_virtual_destructor<std::runtime_error>::value << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 std::string has a virtual destructor? false
 std::runtime_error has a virtual destructor? true
