.SH Synopsis
   time_point& operator+=( const duration& d ); \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
                                                    (constexpr since C++17)
   time_point& operator-=( const duration& d ); \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
                                                    (constexpr since C++17)

   Modifies the time point by the given duration.

   1) Applies the offset d to pt. Effectively, d is added to the internally stored
   duration d_ as d_ += d.
   2) Applies the offset d to pt in negative direction. Effectively, d is subtracted
   from internally stored duration d_ as d_ -= d.

.SH Parameters

   d - a time offset to apply

.SH Return value

   *this

.SH Exceptions

   May throw implementation-defined exceptions.
