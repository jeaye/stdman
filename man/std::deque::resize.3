.SH NAME
std::deque::resize \- std::deque::resize

.SH Synopsis
   void resize( size_type count );                          \fB(1)\fP
   void resize( size_type count, const value_type& value ); \fB(2)\fP

   Resizes the container to contain count elements, does nothing if count == size().

   If the current size is greater than count, the container is reduced to its first
   count elements.

   If the current size is less than count,

   1) additional default-inserted elements are appended.
   2) additional copies of value are appended.

.SH Parameters

   count            -           new size of the container
   value            -           the value to initialize the new elements with
.SH Type requirements
   -
   T must meet the requirements of MoveInsertable and DefaultInsertable in order to use
   overload \fB(1)\fP.
   -
   T must meet the requirements of CopyInsertable in order to use overload \fB(2)\fP.

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Complexity

   Linear in the difference between the current size and count.

.SH Notes

   If value-initialization in overload \fB(1)\fP is undesirable, for example, if the elements
   are of non-class type and zeroing out is not needed, it can be avoided by providing
   a custom Allocator::construct.

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <deque>
 #include <iostream>

 void print(auto rem, const std::deque<int>& c)
 {
     for (std::cout << rem; const int el : c)
         std::cout << el << ' ';
     std::cout << '\\n';
 }

 int main()
 {
     std::deque<int> c = {1, 2, 3};
     print("The deque holds: ", c);

     c.resize(5);
     print("After resize up to 5: ", c);

     c.resize(2);
     print("After resize down to 2: ", c);

     c.resize(6, 4);
     print("After resize up to 6 (initializer = 4): ", c);
 }

.SH Output:

 The deque holds: 1 2 3
 After resize up to 5: 1 2 3 0 0
 After resize down to 2: 1 2
 After resize up to 6 (initializer = 4): 1 2 4 4 4 4

   previously published C++ standards.

      DR    Applied to         Behavior as published              Correct behavior
   LWG 679  C++98      resize() passed value by value         passes by const reference
   LWG 1418 C++98      the behavior of resize(size()) was not specified
                       specified
                       1. elements were removed by using
   LWG 2033 C++11      erase()                                1. uses pop_back()
                       2. T was not required to be            2. required
