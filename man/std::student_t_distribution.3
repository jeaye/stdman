.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <random>
   template< class RealType = double >  \fI(since C++11)\fP
   class student_t_distribution;

   Produces random floating-point values x, distributed according to probability
   density function:

   P(x|n) =

   1
   √
   nπ

   ·

   Γ(

   n+1
   2

   )
   Γ(

   n
   2

   )

   · ⎛
   ⎜
   ⎝1+

   x2
   n

   ⎞
   ⎟
   ⎠ -

   n+1
   2

   where n is known as the number of degrees of freedom. This distribution is used when
   estimating the mean of an unknown normally distributed value given n+1 independent
   measurements, each with additive errors of unknown standard deviation, as in
   physical measurements. Or, alternatively, when estimating the unknown mean of a
   normal distribution with unknown standard deviation, given n+1 samples.

.SH Member types

   Member type Definition
   result_type RealType
   param_type  the type of the parameter set, unspecified

.SH Member functions

   constructor   constructs new distribution
                 \fI(public member function)\fP 
   reset         resets the internal state of the distribution
                 \fI(public member function)\fP 
.SH Generation
   operator()    generates the next random number in the distribution
                 \fI(public member function)\fP 
.SH Characteristics
   n             returns the n distribution parameter (degrees of freedom)
                 \fI(public member function)\fP 
   param         gets or sets the distribution parameter object
                 \fI(public member function)\fP 
   min           returns the minimum potentially generated value
                 \fI(public member function)\fP 
   max           returns the maximum potentially generated value
                 \fI(public member function)\fP 

.SH Non-member functions

   operator== compares two distribution objects
   operator!= \fI(function)\fP 
   operator<< performs stream input and output on pseudo-random number distribution
   operator>> \fI(function)\fP
