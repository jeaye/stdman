.TH std::time 3 "2018.03.28" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::time \- std::time

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <ctime>
   std::time_t time( std::time_t* arg );

   Returns the current calendar time encoded as a std::time_t object, and also stores
   it in the object pointed to by arg, unless arg is a null pointer.

.SH Parameters

   arg - pointer to a std::time_t object to store the time, or a null pointer

.SH Return value

   Current calendar time encoded as std::time_t object on success, (std::time_t)(-1) on
   error. If arg is not null, the return value is also stored in the object pointed to
   by arg.

.SH Notes

   The encoding of calendar time in std::time_t is unspecified, but most systems
   conform to POSIX specification and return a value of integral type holding the
   number of seconds since the Epoch. Implementations in which std::time_t is a 32-bit
   signed integer (many historical implementations) fail in the year 2038.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <ctime>
 #include <iostream>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::time_t result = std::time(nullptr);
     std::cout << std::asctime(std::localtime(&result))
               << result << " seconds since the Epoch\\n";
 }

.SH Output:

 Wed Sep 21 10:27:52 2011
 1316615272 seconds since the Epoch
