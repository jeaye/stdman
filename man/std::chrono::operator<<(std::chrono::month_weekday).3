.SH NAME
std::chrono::operator<<(std::chrono::month_weekday) \- std::chrono::operator<<(std::chrono::month_weekday)

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <chrono>
   template< class CharT, class Traits >

   std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>&                        \fI(since C++20)\fP
       operator<<( std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& os,

                   const std::chrono::month_weekday& mwd );

   Outputs a textual representation of mwd into os, as if by

   os << std::format(os.getloc(), STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{:L}/{:L}"),
                     mwd.month(), mwd.weekday_indexed());

   where STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{:L}/{:L}") is "{:L}/{:L}" if CharT is char, and
   L"{:L}/{:L}" if CharT is wchar_t.

   os
