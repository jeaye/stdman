.SH NAME
std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio \- std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio

.SH Synopsis
   static bool sync_with_stdio( bool sync = true );

   Sets whether the standard C++ streams are synchronized to the standard C streams
   after each input/output operation.

   The standard C++ streams are the following: std::cin, std::cout, std::cerr,
   std::clog, std::wcin, std::wcout, std::wcerr and std::wclog

   The standard C streams are the following: stdin, stdout and stderr

   For a standard stream str, synchronized with the C stream f, the following pairs of
   functions have identical effect:

   1) std::fputc(f, c) and str.rdbuf()->sputc(c)
   2) std::fgetc(f) and str.rdbuf()->sbumpc()
   3) std::ungetc(c, f) and str.rdbuf()->sputbackc(c)

   In practice, this means that the synchronized C++ streams are unbuffered, and each
   I/O operation on a C++ stream is immediately applied to the corresponding C stream's
   buffer. This makes it possible to freely mix C++ and C I/O.

   In addition, synchronized C++ streams are guaranteed to be thread-safe (individual
   characters output from multiple threads may interleave, but no data races occur)

   If the synchronization is turned off, the C++ standard streams are allowed to buffer
   their I/O independently, which may be considerably faster in some cases.

   By default, all eight standard C++ streams are synchronized with their respective C
   streams.

   If this function is called after some I/O had occurred on the standard stream, the
   behavior is implementation-defined: implementations range from no effect to
   destroying the read buffer.

.SH Parameters

   sync - the new synchronization setting

.SH Return value

   synchronization state before the call to the function

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <cstdio>

 int main()
 {
     std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
     std::cout << "a\\n";
     std::printf("b\\n");
     std::cout << "c\\n";
 }

.SH Possible output:

 b
 a
 c
