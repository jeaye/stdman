   std::deque (double-ended queue) is an indexed sequence container that allows fast
   insertion and deletion at both its beginning and its end. In addition, insertion and
   deletion at either end of a deque never invalidates pointers or references to the
   rest of the elements.

   As opposed to std::vector, the elements of a deque are not stored contiguously:
   typical implementations use a sequence of individually allocated fixed-size arrays,
   with additional bookkeeping, which means indexed access to deque must perform two
   pointer dereferences, compared to vector's indexed access which performs only one.

   The storage of a deque is automatically expanded and contracted as needed. Expansion
   of a deque is cheaper than the expansion of a std::vector because it does not
   involve copying of the existing elements to a new memory location. On the other
   hand, deques typically have large minimal memory cost; a deque holding just one
   element has to allocate its full internal array (e.g. 8 times the object size on
   64-bit libstdc++; 16 times the object size or 4096 bytes, whichever is larger, on
   64-bit libc++).

   The complexity (efficiency) of common operations on deques is as follows:

     * Random access - constant O(1)
     * Insertion or removal of elements at the end or beginning - constant O(1)
     * Insertion or removal of elements - linear O(n)

   std::deque meets the requirements of Container, AllocatorAwareContainer,
   SequenceContainer and ReversibleContainer.

.SH Template parameters

               The type of the elements.

               T must meet the requirements of CopyAssignable and         \fI(until C++11)\fP
               CopyConstructible.
               The requirements that are imposed on the elements depend
   T         - on the actual operations performed on the container.
               Generally, it is required that element type is a complete  \fI(since C++11)\fP
               type and meets the requirements of Erasable, but many
               member functions impose stricter requirements.

               
               An allocator that is used to acquire/release memory and to
   Allocator - construct/destroy the elements in that memory. The type must meet the
               requirements of Allocator. The behavior is undefined if
               Allocator::value_type is not the same as T.

                                          the past-the-end iterator
                                          Otherwise - all iterators are invalidated
                                          (including the past-the-end iterator).
                                          If the new size is smaller than the old one :
                                          only erased elements and the past-the-end

                                          Otherwise - none iterators are invalidated.

                                          past-the-end iterator

     Invalidation notes

     * When inserting at either end of the deque, references are not invalidated by
       insert and emplace.
     * push_front, push_back, emplace_front and emplace_back do not invalidate any
       references to elements of the deque.
     * When erasing at either end of the deque, references to non-erased elements are
       not invalidated by erase, pop_front and pop_back.
     * A call to resize with a smaller size does not invalidate any references to
       non-erased elements.
     * A call to resize with a bigger size does not invalidate any references to
       elements of the deque.
