.SH NAME
std::moneypunct \- std::moneypunct

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <locale>
   template< class CharT, bool International = false >
   class moneypunct;

   The facet std::moneypunct encapsulates monetary value format preferences. Stream I/O
   manipulators std::get_money and std::put_money use std::moneypunct through
   std::money_get and std::money_put for parsing monetary value input and formatting
   monetary value output.

   Four standalone (locale-independent) specializations are provided by the standard
   library:

   Defined in header <locale>
   std::moneypunct<char>          provides equivalents of the "C" locale preferences
   std::moneypunct<wchar_t>       provides wide character equivalents of the "C" locale
                                  preferences
   std::moneypunct<char, true>    provides equivalents of the "C" locale preferences,
                                  with international currency symbols
   std::moneypunct<wchar_t, true> provides wide character equivalents of the "C" locale
                                  preferences, with international currency symbols

   In addition, every locale object constructed in a C++ program implements its own
   (locale-specific) versions of these specializations.
