.SH NAME
std::exponential_distribution::exponential_distribution \- std::exponential_distribution::exponential_distribution

.SH Synopsis
   exponential_distribution() : exponential_distribution(1.0) {}  \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   explicit exponential_distribution( RealType lambda );          \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   explicit exponential_distribution( const param_type& params ); \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Constructs a new distribution object.

   2) Uses lambda as the distribution parameter.
   3) Uses params as the distribution parameter.

.SH Parameters

   lambda - the λ distribution parameter (the rate parameter)
   params - the distribution parameter set

.SH Notes

   Requires that 0 < lambda.
