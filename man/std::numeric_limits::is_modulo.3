.SH NAME
std::numeric_limits::is_modulo \- std::numeric_limits::is_modulo

.SH Synopsis
   static const bool is_modulo;      \fI(until C++11)\fP
   static constexpr bool is_modulo;  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   The value of std::numeric_limits<T>::is_modulo is true for all arithmetic types T
   that
   are possible to
   \fI(until C++11)\fPhandle overflows with modulo arithmetic, that is, if the result of
   addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division of this type would fall outside
   the range [min(), max()], the value returned by such operation differs from the
   expected value by a multiple of max()-min()+1.

   is_modulo is false for signed integer types, unless the implementation \fI(since C++11)\fP
   defines signed integer overflow to wrap.

.SH Notes

   Although the C++11 standard still says "On most machines, this is true for signed
   integers.", it is a defect and has been corrected. The exact wording changed from
   C++03 to C++11 in such a way that the true value is no longer compatible with
   undefined behavior on signed integer overflow. Because of that, the implementations
   that rely on signed overflow being undefined (for optimization opportunities) now
   set is_modulo to false for signed integers. See for example GCC PR 22200.

.SH Example

   Demonstrates the behavior of modulo types


// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <type_traits>
 #include <limits>

 template<class T>
 typename std::enable_if<std::numeric_limits<T>::is_modulo>::type
     check_overflow()
 {
     std::cout << "\\nmax value is " << std::numeric_limits<T>::max() << '\\n'
               << "min value is " << std::numeric_limits<T>::min() << '\\n'
               << "max value + 1 is " << std::numeric_limits<T>::max()+1 << '\\n';
 }

 int main()
 {
     check_overflow<int>();
     check_overflow<unsigned long>();
     // check_overflow<float>(); // compile-time error, not a modulo type
 }

.SH Possible output:

 max value is 2147483647
 min value is -2147483648
 max value + 1 is -2147483648

 max value is 18446744073709551615
 min value is 0
 max value + 1 is 0
