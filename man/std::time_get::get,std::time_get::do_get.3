   1) Parses the date and time from the input character sequence [beg, end) according
   to the format provided in the character sequence [fmtbeg, fmtend). The format is
   expected to follow the format described below, although actual processing of each
   format specifier can be customized by overriding do_get. The get function performs
   the following: First, clears the error bits in err by executing err =
   std::ios_base::goodbit. Then enters a loop, which terminates whenever any of the
   following conditions becomes true (checked in this order):
   a) All characters have been read from the format string (fmtbeg == fmtend)
   b) There was a parsing error (err != std::ios_base::goodbit)
   c) All characters have been read from the input sequence (beg == end. If this
   condition terminates the loop, the function sets both eofbit and failbit in err

   In the body of the loop, the following steps take place:
   a) if the next character in the format string is '%', followed by one or two
   characters that form a valid std::get_time conversion specifier (see below), these
   characters are used in the call do_get(beg, end, str, err, t, format, modifier),
   where format is the primary conversion specifier character, and modifier is the
   optional modifier (which appears between % and the format character, if present). If
   there is no modifier, the value '\\0' is used. If the format string is ambiguous or
   ends too early to determine the conversion specifier after '%', eofbit is set in err
   and the loop is terminated. If, after the call to do_get, no error bits are set in
   err, the function increments fmtbeg to point right after the conversion specifier
   and continues the loop.
   b) If the next character is whitespace, as indicated by the locale provided in the
   stream str (i.e. std::isspace(*fmtbeg, str.getloc()) == true, the function keeps
   incrementing fmtbeg until it either becomes equal to fmtend or points to a
   non-whitespace character.
   c) If the next character in the format string is equivalent to the next character in
   the input stream according to case-insensitive comparison, the function advances
   both sequences by one character ++fmtbeg, ++beg; and continues the loop, Otherwise,
   it sets the failbit in err.
   2) Parses one conversion specifier from the input sequence [beg, end) and updates
   the std::tm structure pointed to by t accordingly.

   First, clears the error bits in err by executing err = std::ios_base::goodbit. Then
   reads characters from the input sequence [beg, end) that are expected by the
   std::time_get format specifier formed by combining '%', modifier (if not '\\0'), and
   format. If the characters do not combine to form a valid conversion specifier, sets
   failbit in err. If the end of the input stream is reached after reading a character,
   sets eofbit in err. If the input string was parsed successfully, updates the
   corresponding fields of *t.

   For complex conversion specifiers, such as '%x' or '%c', or the directives that use
   the modifiers 'E' and 'O', the function may fail to determine some of the values to
   store in *t. In such case, it sets eofbit in err and leaves these fields in
   unspecified state.

.SH Parameters

   beg      - iterator designating the start of the sequence to parse
   end      - one past the end iterator for the sequence to parse
              a stream object that this function uses to obtain locale facets when
   str      - needed, e.g. std::ctype to skip whitespace or std::collate to compare
              strings
   err      - stream error flags object that is modified by this function to indicate
              errors
   t        - pointer to the std::tm object that will hold the result of this function
              call
              pointer to the first character of a sequence of char_type characters
              specifying the conversion format

              The format string consists of zero or more conversion specifiers,
              whitespace characters, and ordinary characters (except %). Each ordinary
              character is expected to match one character in the input stream in
              case-insensitive comparison. Each whitespace character matches arbitrary
              whitespace in the input string. Each conversion specification begins with
              % character, optionally followed by E or O modifier (ignored if
              unsupported by the locale), followed by the character that determines the
              behavior of the specifier. The format specifiers match the POSIX function
              strptime():

.SH Return value

   Iterator pointing one past the last character in [beg, end) that was parsed
   successfully.

.SH Notes

   The case-insensitive comparison for the non-whitespace non-'%' characters in the
   format string, the std::collate facet of the locale provided by str is typically,
   but not necessarily, used.

   If a parsing error is encountered, many implementations of this function leave *t
   completely untouched.

   It's unspecified if these functions zero out the fields in *t that they do not set
   directly: portable programs should initialize every field to zero before calling
   get().
