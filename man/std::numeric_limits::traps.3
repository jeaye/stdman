.TH std::numeric_limits::traps 3 "Sep  4 2015" "2.0 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   static const bool traps      \fI(until C++11)\fP
   static constexpr bool traps  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   The value of std::numeric_limits<T>::traps is true for all arithmetic types T that
   have at least one value that, if used as an argument to an arithmetic operation,
   will generate a trap.

.SH Notes

   On most platforms integer division by zero always traps, and
   std::numeric_limits<T>::traps is true for all integer types that support the value
   0. The exception is the type bool: even though division by false traps due to
   integral promotion from bool to int, it is the zero-valued int that traps. Zero is
   not a value of type bool.

   On most platforms, floating-point exceptions may be turned on and off at run time
   (e.g. feenableexcept() on Linux or _controlfp on Windows), in which case the value
   of std::numeric_limits<T>::traps for floating-point types reflects the state of
   floating-point trapping facility at the time of program startup, which is false on
   most modern systems. An exception would be a DEC Alpha program, where it is true if
   compiled without -ieee.
