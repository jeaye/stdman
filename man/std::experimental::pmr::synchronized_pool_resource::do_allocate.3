.SH NAME
std::experimental::pmr::synchronized_pool_resource::do_allocate \- std::experimental::pmr::synchronized_pool_resource::do_allocate

.SH Synopsis
   virtual void* do_allocate(std::size_t bytes, std::size_t   (library fundamentals TS)
   alignment);

   Allocates storage.

   If the pool selected for a block of size bytes is unable to satisfy the request from
   its internal data structures, calls allocate() on the upstream memory resource to
   obtain memory.

   If the size requested is larger than what the largest pool can handle, memory is
   allocated by calling allocate() on the upstream memory resource.

.SH Return value

   A pointer to allocated storage of at least bytes bytes in size, aligned to the
   specified alignment if such alignment is supported, and to alignof(std::max_align_t)
   otherwise.

.SH Exceptions

   Throws nothing unless calling allocate() on the upstream memory resource throws.
