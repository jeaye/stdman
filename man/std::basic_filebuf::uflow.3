.SH NAME
std::basic_filebuf::uflow \- std::basic_filebuf::uflow

.SH Synopsis
   protected:
   virtual int_type uflow()

   Behaves like the underflow(), except that if underflow() succeeds (does not return
   Traits::eof()), then advances the next pointer for the get area. In other words,
   consumes one of the characters obtained by underflow().

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   The value of the character that was read and consumed in case of success, or
   Traits::eof() in case of failure.
