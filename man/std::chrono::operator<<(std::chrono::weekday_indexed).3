std::chrono::operator<<(std::chrono::weekday_indexed) \- std::chrono::operator<<(std::chrono::weekday_indexed)

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <chrono>
   template <class CharT, class Traits>

   std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>&                  \fI(since C++20)\fP
   operator<<( std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& os,

   const std::chrono::weekday_indexed& wdi );

   Outputs a textual representation of wdi into the stream os, as if by:

   if (wdi.index() >=1 && wdi.index() <= 5) {
   os << std::format(os.getloc(), STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{:L}[{}]"),
   wdi.weekday(), wdi.index());
   } else {
   os << std::format(os.getloc(), STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{:L}[{} is not a valid
   index]"),
   wdi.weekday(), wdi.index());
   }

   where STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("...") is "..." if CharT is char, and L"..." if CharT
   is wchar_t.

.SH Return value

   os.
