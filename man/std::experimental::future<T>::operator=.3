.SH NAME
std::experimental::future<T>::operator= \- std::experimental::future<T>::operator=

.SH Synopsis
   std::experimental::future<T>& operator=( std::experimental::future<T>&& other ) \fB(1)\fP
   noexcept;
   std::experimental::future<T>& operator=( const std::experimental::future<T>&    \fB(2)\fP
   other ) = delete;

   Assigns the contents of another future object.

   1) Releases any shared state and move-assigns the contents of other to *this. After
   the assignment, other.valid() == false and this->valid() will yield the same value
   as other.valid() before the assignment.

   2) std::experimental::future is not CopyAssignable.

.SH Parameters

   other - a std::experimental::future that will transfer state to *this

.SH Return value

   *this
