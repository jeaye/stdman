.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/latch>
   class latch;                            (concurrency TS)

   The latch class is a downward counter of type ptrdiff_t which can be used to
   synchronize threads. The value of the counter is initialized on creation. Threads
   may block on the latch until the counter is decremented to zero. There is no
   possibility to increase or reset the counter, which makes the latch a single-use
   barrier.

   Unlike std::experimental::barrier, std::experimental::latch can be decremented by a
   participating thread more than once.
