.SH NAME
std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator::allocate_object \- std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator::allocate_object

.SH Synopsis
   template< class U >                                     \fI(since C++20)\fP
   [[nodiscard]] U* allocate_object( std::size_t n = 1 );

   Allocates storage for n objects of type U using the underlying memory resource.

   If std::numeric_limits<std::size_t>::max() / sizeof(U) < n, throws
   std::bad_array_new_length, otherwise equivalent to return
   static_cast<U*>(allocate_bytes(n * sizeof(U), alignof(U)));.

.SH Parameters

   n - the number of objects to allocate storage for

.SH Return value

   A pointer to the allocated storage.

.SH Notes

   This function was introduced for use with the fully-specialized allocator
   std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<>, but it may be useful in any specialization as a
   shortcut to avoid having to rebind from std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<T> to
   std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<U>.

   Since U is not deduced, it must be provided as a template argument when calling this
   function.

.SH Exceptions

   Throws std::bad_array_new_length if n > std::numeric_limits<std::size_t>::max() /
   sizeof(U); may also be any exceptions thrown by the call to resource()->allocate.
