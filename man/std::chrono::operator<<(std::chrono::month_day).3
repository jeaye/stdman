.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <chrono>
   template< class CharT, class Traits >

   std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>&                                     \fI(since C++20)\fP

   operator<<( std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& os, const
   std::chrono::month_day& md );

   Outputs a textual representation of md into the stream os, as if by

   os << std::format(os.getloc(), STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{:L}/{}"), md.month(),
   md.day())

   where STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{:L}/{}") is "{:L}/{}" if CharT is char, and
   L"{:L}/{}" if CharT is wchar_t.

.SH Return value

   os.
