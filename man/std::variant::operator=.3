   Assigns a new value to an existing variant object

   1) Copy-assignment:

     * If both *this and rhs are valueless by exception, does nothing.
     * Otherwise, if rhs is valueless, but *this is not, destroys the value contained
       in *this and makes it valueless.
     * Otherwise, if rhs holds the same alternative as *this, assigns the value
       contained in rhs to the value contained in *this. If an exception is thrown,
       *this does not become valueless: the value depends on the exception safety
       guarantee of the alternative's copy assignment.
     * Otherwise, if the alternative held by other is either nothrow copy constructible
       or not nothrow move constructible (as determined by
       std::is_nothrow_copy_constructible and std::is_nothrow_move_constructible,
       respectively), equivalent to
       this->emplace<other.index()>(get<other.index()>(other)).
     * Otherwise, equivalent to this->operator=(variant(rhs)).

   This overload only participates in overload resolution if
   std::is_copy_constructible_v<T_i> && std::is_copy_assignable_v<T_i> is true for all
   T_i in Types...
   2) Move-assignment:

     * If both *this and rhs are valueless by exception, does nothing
     * Otherwise, if rhs is valueless, but *this is not, destroys the value contained
       in *this and makes it valueless
     * Otherwise, if rhs holds the same alternative as *this, assigns
       std::get<j>(std::move(rhs)) to the value contained in *this, with j being
       index(). If an exception is thrown, *this does not become valueless: the value
       depends on the exception safety guarantee of the alternative's move assignment.
     * Otherwise (if rhs and *this hold different alternatives), equivalent to
       this->emplace<other.index()>(get<other.index()>(std::move(other))). If an
       exception is thrown by T_i's move constructor, *this becomes
       valueless_by_exception.

   This overload only participates in overload resolution if
   std::is_move_constructible_v<T_i> && std::is_move_assignable_v<T_i> is true for all
   T_i in Types....
   3) Converting assignment.

     * Determines the alternative type T_j that would be selected by overload
       resolution for the expression F(std::forward<T>(t)) if there was an overload of
       imaginary function F(T_i) for every T_i from Types... in scope at the same time.
     * If *this already holds a T_j, assigns std::forward<T>(t) to the value contained
       in *this. If an exception is thrown, *this does not become valueless: the value
       depends on the exception safety guarantee of the assignment called.
     * Otherwise, if std::is_nothrow_constructible_v<T_j, T> ||
       !std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<T_j> is true, equivalent to
       this->emplace<j>(std::forward<T>(t));
     * Otherwise, equivalent to this->operator=(variant(std::forward<T>(t))).

   This overload only participates in overload resolution if
   std::is_same_v<std::decay_t<T>, variant> is false and std::is_assignable_v<T_j&, T>
   is true and std::is_constructible_v<T_j, T> is true and the expression
   F(std::forward<T>(t)) (with F being the above-mentioned set of imaginary functions)
   is well formed

 variant<string> v1;
 v1 = "abc"; // OK
 variant<string, string> v2;
 v2 = "abc"; // Error
 variant <string, bool> v3;
 v3 = "abc"; // OK but chooses bool

.SH Parameters

   rhs - another variant
   t   - a value convertible to one of the variant's alternatives

.SH Return value

   *this

   alternative
