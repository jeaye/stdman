   Defined in header <set>
   template<

   class Key,
   class Compare = std::less<Key>,                                    \fB(1)\fP

   std::polymorphic_allocator<Key>>;

   }

   std::set is an associative container that contains a sorted set of unique objects of
   type Key. Sorting is done using the key comparison function Compare. Search,
   removal, and insertion operations have logarithmic complexity. Sets are usually
   implemented as red-black trees.

   Everywhere the standard library uses the Compare concept, uniqueness is determined
   by using the equivalence relation. In imprecise terms, two objects a and b are
   considered equivalent (not unique) if neither compares less than the other: !comp(a,
   b) && !comp(b, a).

   std::set meets the requirements of Container, AllocatorAwareContainer,
   AssociativeContainer and ReversibleContainer.

.SH Notes

   The member types iterator and const_iterator may be aliases to the same type. Since
   iterator is convertible to const_iterator, const_iterator should be used in function
   parameter lists to avoid violations of the One Definition Rule.
