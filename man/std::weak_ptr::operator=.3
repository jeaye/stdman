   weak_ptr& operator=( const shared_ptr<Y>& r ) noexcept;
   weak_ptr& operator=( weak_ptr&& r ) noexcept;           \fB(4)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   template< class Y >                                     \fB(5)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   weak_ptr& operator=( weak_ptr<Y>&& r ) noexcept;

   Replaces the managed object with the one managed by r. The object is shared with r.
   If r manages no object, *this manages no object too.

   1-3) Equivalent to std::weak_ptr<T>(r).swap(*this).
   4,5) Equivalent to std::weak_ptr<T>(std::move(r)).swap(*this).

.SH Parameters

   r - smart pointer to share an object with

.SH Return value

   *this

.SH Notes

   The implementation may meet the requirements without creating a temporary weak_ptr
   object.
