.TH std::thread::joinable 3 "Nov 16 2016" "2.1 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::thread::joinable \- std::thread::joinable

.SH Synopsis
   bool joinable() const;  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Checks if the thread object identifies an active thread of execution. Specifically,
   returns true if get_id() != std::thread::id(). So a default constructed thread is
   not joinable.

   A thread that has finished executing code, but has not yet been joined is still
   considered an active thread of execution and is therefore joinable.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   true if the thread object identifies an active thread of execution, false otherwise

.SH Exceptions

   noexcept specification:
   noexcept

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <thread>
 #include <chrono>

 void foo()
 {
     std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
 }

 int main()
 {
     std::thread t;
     std::cout << "before starting, joinable: " << t.joinable() << '\\n';

     t = std::thread(foo);
     std::cout << "after starting, joinable: " << t.joinable() << '\\n';

     t.join();
     std::cout << "after joining, joinable: " << t.joinable() << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 before starting, joinable: 0
 after starting, joinable: 1
 after joining, joinable: 0
