.SH NAME
std::unique_lock::try_lock \- std::unique_lock::try_lock

.SH Synopsis
   bool try_lock();  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Tries to lock the associated mutex without blocking. Effectively calls
   mutex()->try_lock().

   std::system_error is thrown if there is no associated mutex or if the mutex is
   already locked by this std::unique_lock.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   true if the ownership of the mutex has been acquired successfully, false otherwise.

.SH Exceptions

     * Any exceptions thrown by mutex()->try_lock() (Mutex types do not throw in
       try_lock, but a custom Lockable might)

     * If there is no associated mutex, std::system_error with an error code of
       std::errc::operation_not_permitted

     * If the mutex is already locked by this std::unique_lock, std::system_error with
       an error code of std::errc::resource_deadlock_would_occur
