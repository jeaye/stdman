.SH Synopsis
   bool try_lock();  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Tries to lock the associated mutex without blocking. Effectively calls

   std::system_error is thrown if there is no associated mutex or if the mutex is
   already locked.

.SH Parameters

.SH Return value

   true if the ownership of the mutex has been acquired successfully, false otherwise.

.SH Exceptions

     * Any exceptions thrown by mutex()->try_lock()

     * If there is no associated mutex, std::system_error with an error code of
       std::errc::operation_not_permitted

     * If the mutex is already locked, std::system_error with an error code of
       std::errc::resource_deadlock_would_occur
