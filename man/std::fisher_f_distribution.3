.TH std::fisher_f_distribution 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <random>
   template< class RealType = double >  \fI(since C++11)\fP
   class fisher_f_distribution;

   The fisher_f_distribution class is a RandomNumberDistribution that produces random
   numbers according to the f-distribution:

   p(x;m,n) =

   Γ((m+n)/2)
   Γ(m/2) Γ(n/2)

   (m/n)m/2
   x(m/2)-1
   (1+

   mx
   n

   )-(m+n)/2

   m and n are the degrees of freedom.

.SH Member functions

   constructor   constructs new distribution
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
   reset         resets the internal state of the distribution
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
.SH Generation
   operator()    generates the next random number in the distribution
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
.SH Characteristics
   m             returns the distribution parameters
   n             \fI(public member function)\fP
   param         gets or sets the distribution parameter object
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
   min           returns the minimum potentially generated value
                 \fI(public member function)\fP
