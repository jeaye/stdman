.SH NAME
std::experimental::basic_string_view \- std::experimental::basic_string_view

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/string_view>
   template<

   class CharT,                                  (library fundamentals TS)
   class Traits = std::char_traits<CharT>

   > class basic_string_view;

   The class template basic_string_view describes an object that can refer to a
   constant contiguous sequence of char-like objects with the first element of the
   sequence at position zero.

   A typical implementation holds only two members: a pointer to constant CharT and a
   size.

   Several typedefs for common character types are provided:

.SH Template parameters

   CharT  - character type
   Traits - traits class specifying the operations on the character type

.SH Member types

   Member type            Definition
   traits_type            Traits
   value_type             CharT
   pointer                CharT*
   const_pointer          const CharT*
   reference              CharT&
   const_reference        const CharT&
   const_iterator         implementation-defined LegacyRandomAccessIterator
   iterator               const_iterator
   reverse_iterator       const_reverse_iterator
   const_reverse_iterator std::reverse_iterator<const_iterator>
   size_type              std::size_t
   difference_type        std::ptrdiff_t

   Note: iterator and const_iterator are the same type because string views are views
   into constant character sequences.
