.SH NAME
std::strong_equal \- std::strong_equal

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <compare>
   template< class T >                                                   \fI(since C++20)\fP
   constexpr std::strong_equality strong_equal(const T& a, const T& b);

   Compares two values using 3-way comparison and produces a result of type
   std::strong_equality

   Specifically,

     * If the expression a <=> b is well-formed and its result is convertible to
       std::strong_equality, returns that result.
     * Otherwise, if the expression a <=> b is well-formed, but its result is not
       convertible to std::strong_equality, then the function is defined as deleted.
     * Otherwise, if the expression a <=> b is ill-formed, but the expression a == b is
       well-formed and convertible to bool,

              * if a == b is true, returns std::strong_equality::equal
              * otherwise, returns std::strong_equality::nonequal

     * Otherwise, the function is defined as deleted.

.SH Parameters

   a, b - values to compare

.SH Return value

   A value of type std::strong_equality, as described above.
