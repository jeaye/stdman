   struct owner_less<void>;

   This function object provides owner-based (as opposed to value-based) mixed-type
   ordering of both std::weak_ptr and std::shared_ptr. The order is such that two smart
   pointers compare equivalent only if they are both empty or if they both manage the
   same object, even if the values of the raw pointers obtained by get() are different
   (e.g. because they point at different subobjects within the same object)

   This class template is the preferred comparison predicate when building associative
   containers with std::shared_ptr or std::weak_ptr as keys, that is,

   std::map<std::shared_ptr<T>, U, std::owner_less<std::shared_ptr<T>>>

   or

   std::map<std::weak_ptr<T>, U, std::owner_less<std::weak_ptr<T>>>.

   The default operator< is not defined for weak pointers, and may wrongly consider two
   shared pointers for the same object non-equivalent (see shared_ptr::owner_before)

.SH Specializations

   The standard library provides a specialization of std::owner_less when
   T is not specified. In this case, the parameter types are deduced from
   the arguments (each of which must still be either a std::shared_ptr or
   a std::weak_ptr).
                                                                          \fI(since C++17)\fP
                    function object providing mixed-type owner-based
   owner_less<void> ordering of shared and weak pointers, regardless of
                    the type of the pointee
                    \fI(class template specialization)\fP

   std::weak_ptr<T>& lhs,                (member only of owner_less<weak_ptr<T>>
   const std::weak_ptr<T>& rhs ) const;  template specialization)

   Compares lhs and rhs using owner-based semantics. Effectively calls
   lhs.owner_before(rhs).

   The ordering is strict weak ordering relation.

   lhs and rhs are equivalent only if they are both empty or share ownership.

.SH Parameters

   lhs, rhs - shared-ownership pointers to compare

.SH Return value

   true if lhs is less than rhs as determined by the owner-based ordering.

.SH Exceptions

   \fI(none)\fP
