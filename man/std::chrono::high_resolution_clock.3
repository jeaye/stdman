.SH NAME
std::chrono::high_resolution_clock \- std::chrono::high_resolution_clock

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <chrono>
   class high_resolution_clock;  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Class std::chrono::high_resolution_clock represents the clock with the smallest tick
   period provided by the implementation. It may be an alias of
   std::chrono::system_clock or std::chrono::steady_clock, or a third, independent
   clock.

   std::chrono::high_resolution_clock meets the requirements of TrivialClock.

.SH Member types

   Member type Definition
   rep         arithmetic type representing the number of ticks in the clock's duration
   period      a std::ratio type representing the tick period of the clock, in seconds
   duration    std::chrono::duration<rep, period>
   time_point  std::chrono::time_point<std::chrono::high_resolution_clock>

.SH Member constants

                            true if the time between ticks is always constant, i.e.
   constexpr bool is_steady calls to now() return values that increase monotonically
   \fB[static]\fP                 even in case of some external clock adjustment, otherwise
                            false
                            \fI(public static member constant)\fP

.SH Member functions

   now      returns a std::chrono::time_point representing the current value of the
   \fB[static]\fP clock
            \fI(public static member function)\fP
