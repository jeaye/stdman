.TH std::thread::join 3 "2018.03.28" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::thread::join \- std::thread::join

.SH Synopsis
   void join();  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Blocks the current thread until the thread identified by *this finishes its
   execution.

   The completion of the thread identified by *this synchronizes with the corresponding
   successful return from join().

   No synchronization is performed on *this itself. Concurrently calling join() on the
   same std::thread object from multiple threads constitutes a data race that results
   in undefined behavior.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Postconditions

   joinable() is false

.SH Exceptions

   std::system_error if an error occurs.

.SH Error Conditions

     * resource_deadlock_would_occur if this->get_id() == std::this_thread::get_id()
       \fI(deadlock detected)\fP
     * no_such_process if the thread is not valid
     * invalid_argument if joinable() is false

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <thread>
 #include <chrono>
  
 void foo()
 {
     // simulate expensive operation
     std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
 }
  
 void bar()
 {
     // simulate expensive operation
     std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
 }
  
 int main()
 {
     std::cout << "starting first helper...\\n";
     std::thread helper1(foo);
  
     std::cout << "starting second helper...\\n";
     std::thread helper2(bar);
  
     std::cout << "waiting for helpers to finish..." << std::endl;
     helper1.join();
     helper2.join();
  
     std::cout << "done!\\n";
 }

.SH Output:

 starting first helper...
 starting second helper...
 waiting for helpers to finish...
 done!
