.SH NAME
std::ranges::slide_view::iterator \- std::ranges::slide_view::iterator

.SH Synopsis
   template< bool Const >  (since C++23)
   class /*iterator*/      (exposition only*)

   The return type of slide_view::begin, and of slide_view::end when the underlying
   view V is a common_range.

   The type /*iterator*/<true> is returned by the const-qualified overloads. The type
   /*iterator*/<false> is returned by the non-const-qualified overloads.

   Data members

   Member type         Definition
                       ranges::iterator_t<Base>, holds an iterator to the first
   current_ (private)  underlying element of the current window in slide_view
                       (exposition-only member object*)
                       ranges::iterator_t<Base>, holds an iterator to the one-past-end
   last_ele_ (private) underlying element of the current window in slide_view. Present
   (optional)          only if Base models /*slide-caches-first*/.
                       (exposition-only member object*)
                       ranges::range_difference_t<Base>, holds the window width of
   n_ (private)        slide_view.
