.SH Synopsis
   normal_distribution() : normal_distribution(0.0) {}                \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   explicit normal_distribution( RealType mean, RealType stddev = 1.0 \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   );
   explicit normal_distribution( const param_type& params );          \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Constructs a new distribution object.

   2) Uses mean and stddev as the distribution parameters.
   3) Uses params as the distribution parameters.

   The behavior is undefined if stddev is not greater than zero.

.SH Parameters

   mean   - the μ distribution parameter (mean)
   stddev - the σ distribution parameter (standard deviation)
   params - the distribution parameter set
