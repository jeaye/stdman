.SH NAME
std::basic_stringstream \- std::basic_stringstream

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <sstream>
   template<

   class CharT,
   class Traits = std::char_traits<CharT>,
   class Allocator = std::allocator<CharT>

   > class basic_stringstream;

   The class template std::basic_stringstream implements input and output operations on
   string based streams. It effectively stores an instance of std::basic_string and
   performs the input and output operations on it.

   At the low level, the class essentially wraps a raw string device implementation of
   std::basic_stringbuf into a higher-level interface of std::basic_iostream. The
   complete interface to unique std::basic_stringbuf members is provided.
