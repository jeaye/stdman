std::initializer_list \- std::initializer_list

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <initializer_list>
   template< class T >                   \fI(since C++11)\fP
   class initializer_list;

   An object of type std::initializer_list<T> is a lightweight proxy object that
   provides access to an array of objects of type const T.

   A std::initializer_list object is automatically constructed when:

     * a braced-init-list is used in list-initialization, including function-call list
       initialization and assignment expressions
     * a braced-init-list is bound to auto, including in a ranged for loop

   Initializer lists may be implemented as a pair of pointers or pointer and length.
   Copying a std::initializer_list does not copy the underlying objects.

   The underlying array is not guaranteed to exist after the lifetime of
   the original initializer list object has ended. The storage for        \fI(until C++14)\fP
   std::initializer_list is unspecified (i.e. it could be automatic,
   temporary, or static read-only memory, depending on the situation).
   The underlying array is a temporary array, in which each element is
   copy-initialized (except that narrowing conversions are invalid) from
   the corresponding element of the original initializer list. The
   lifetime of the underlying array is the same as any other temporary
   object, except that initializing an initializer_list object from the   \fI(since C++14)\fP
   array extends the lifetime of the array exactly like binding a
   reference to a temporary (with the same exceptions, such as for
   initializing a non-static class member). The underlying array may be
   allocated in read-only memory.
   The program is ill-formed if an explicit or partial specialization of  \fI(since C++17)\fP
   std::initializer_list is declared.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <vector>
 #include <initializer_list>
  
 template <class T>
 struct S {
     std::vector<T> v;
     S(std::initializer_list<T> l) : v(l) {
          std::cout << "constructed with a " << l.size() << "-element list\\n";
     }
     void append(std::initializer_list<T> l) {
         v.insert(v.end(), l.begin(), l.end());
     }
     std::pair<const T*, std::size_t> c_arr() const {
         return {&v[0], v.size()};  // copy list-initialization in return statement
                                    // this is NOT a use of std::initializer_list
     }
 };
  
 template <typename T>
 void templated_fn(T) {}
  
 int main()
 {
     S<int> s = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // copy list-initialization
     s.append({6, 7, 8});      // list-initialization in function call
  
     std::cout << "The vector size is now " << s.c_arr().second << " ints:\\n";
  
     for (auto n : s.v)
         std::cout << n << ' ';
     std::cout << '\\n';
  
     std::cout << "Range-for over brace-init-list: \\n";
  
     for (int x : {-1, -2, -3}) // the rule for auto makes this ranged-for work
         std::cout << x << ' ';
     std::cout << '\\n';
  
     auto al = {10, 11, 12};   // special rule for auto
  
     std::cout << "The list bound to auto has size() = " << al.size() << '\\n';
  
 //    templated_fn({1, 2, 3}); // compiler error! "{1, 2, 3}" is not an expression,
                              // it has no type, and so T cannot be deduced
     templated_fn<std::initializer_list<int>>({1, 2, 3}); // OK
     templated_fn<std::vector<int>>({1, 2, 3});           // also OK
 }

.SH Output:

 constructed with a 5-element list
 The vector size is now 8 ints:
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
 Range-for over brace-init-list:
 -1 -2 -3
 The list bound to auto has size() = 3
