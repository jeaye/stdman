.SH NAME
std::char_traits::compare \- std::char_traits::compare

.SH Synopsis
   static int compare( const char_type* s1, const char_type* s2,          \fI(until C++17)\fP
   std::size_t count );
   static constexpr int compare( const char_type* s1, const char_type*    \fI(since C++17)\fP
   s2, std::size_t count );

   Compares the first count characters of the character strings s1 and s2. The
   comparison is done lexicographically.

   If count is zero, strings are considered equal.

.SH Parameters

   s1, s2 - pointers to character strings to compare
   count  - the number of characters to compare from each character string

.SH Return value

   Negative value if s1 is less than s2.

   0 if s1 is equal to s2.

   Positive value if s1 is greater than s2.

.SH Exceptions

   Throws nothing.

.SH Complexity

   Linear in count.
