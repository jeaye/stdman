.SH NAME
std::basic_string::capacity \- std::basic_string::capacity

.SH Synopsis
   size_type capacity() const;

   Returns the number of characters that the string has currently allocated space for.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   capacity of the currently allocated storage

.SH Exceptions

   \fI(none)\fP                  \fI(until C++11)\fP
   noexcept specification: \fI(since C++11)\fP
   noexcept

.SH Complexity

   Constant

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <string>

 void show_capacity(std::string const& s)
 {
     std::cout << "'" << s << "' has capacity " << s.capacity() << ".\\n";
 }

 int main()
 {
     std::string s{"Exemplar"};
     show_capacity(s);

     s += " is an example string.";
     show_capacity(s);
 }

.SH Possible output:

 'Exemplar' has capacity 8.
 'Exemplar is an example string.' has capacity 30.
