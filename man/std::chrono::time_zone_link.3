.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <chrono>
   class time_zone_link;       \fI(since C++20)\fP

   The class time_zone_link represents an alternative name for a time zone.

   Users cannot construct time_zone_link objects. The library implementation creates
   time_zone_link objects when it initializes the time zone database and provides const
   access to these objects.

   time_zone_link is not copyable but does have a defaulted move constructor and a
   defaulted move assignment operator. However, as users have only const access to
   time_zone_link objects, these functions cannot be called in user code without
   invoking undefined behavior.
