.SH NAME
std::norm(std::complex) \- std::norm(std::complex)

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <complex>
   template< class T >                \fB(1)\fP
   T norm( const complex<T>& z );
   long double norm( long double z ); \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   template< class DoubleOrInteger >  \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   double norm( DoubleOrInteger z );
   float norm( float z );             \fB(4)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Returns the squared magnitude of the complex number z.

   \fI(since C++11)\fPAdditional overloads are provided for float, double, long double, and
   all integer types, which are treated as complex numbers with zero imaginary
   component.

.SH Parameters

   z - complex value

.SH Return value

   the squared magnitude of z

.SH Notes

   The norm calculated by this function is also known as field norm or absolute square.

   The Euclidean norm of a complex number is provided by std::abs, which is more costly
   to compute. In some situations, it may be replaced by std::norm, for example, if
   abs(z1) > abs(z2) then norm(z1) > norm(z2).
