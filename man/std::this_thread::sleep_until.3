.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <thread>
   template< class Clock, class Duration >
   void sleep_until( const std::chrono::time_point<Clock,Duration>&       \fI(since C++11)\fP
   sleep_time );

   Blocks the execution of the current thread until specified sleep_time has been
   reached.

   The clock tied to sleep_time is used, which means that adjustments of the clock are
   taken into account. Thus, the duration of the block might, but might not, be less or
   more than sleep_time - Clock::now() at the time of the call, depending on the
   direction of the adjustment. The function also may block for longer than until after
   sleep_time has been reached due to scheduling or resource contention delays.
