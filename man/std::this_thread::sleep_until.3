.SH NAME
std::this_thread::sleep_until \- std::this_thread::sleep_until

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <thread>
   template< class Clock, class Duration >
   void sleep_until( const std::chrono::time_point<Clock, Duration>&      \fI(since C++11)\fP
   sleep_time );

   Blocks the execution of the current thread until specified sleep_time has been
   reached.

   Clock must meet the Clock requirements.
   The program is ill-formed if std::chrono::is_clock_v<Clock> is false.
   \fI(since C++20)\fP

   The standard recommends that the clock tied to sleep_time be used, in which case
   adjustments of the clock may be taken into account. Thus, the duration of the block
   might be more or less than sleep_time - Clock::now() at the time of the call,
   depending on the direction of the adjustment and whether it is honored by the
   implementation. The function also may block until after sleep_time has been reached
   due to process scheduling or resource contention delays.

.SH Parameters

   sleep_time - time to block until

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Exceptions

   Any exception thrown by Clock or Duration (clocks and durations provided by the
   standard library never throw).

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <chrono>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <thread>

 auto now() { return std::chrono::steady_clock::now(); }

 auto awake_time()
 {
     using std::chrono::operator""ms;
     return now() + 2000ms;
 }

 int main()
 {
     std::cout << "Hello, waiter...\\n" << std::flush;
     const auto start{now()};
     std::this_thread::sleep_until(awake_time());
     std::chrono::duration<double, std::milli> elapsed{now() - start};
     std::cout << "Waited " << elapsed.count() << " ms\\n";
 }

.SH Possible output:

 Hello, waiter...
 Waited 2000.17 ms
