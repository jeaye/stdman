.SH Synopsis
   void clear();           \fI(until C++11)\fP
   void clear() noexcept;  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Removes all elements from the container. After this call, size() returns zero.

   Invalidates any references, pointers, or iterators referring to contained elements.
   Any past-the-end iterators are also invalidated.
