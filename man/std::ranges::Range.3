   template< class T >                                                             \fB(3)\fP

   concept __ForwardingRange = Range<T> && __RangeImpl<T>;

   1) The Range concept defines the requirements of a type that allows iteration over
   its elements by providing an iterator and sentinel that denote the elements of the
   range.

   Formally, given an expression E such that decltype((E)) is T, T models Range only if

     * [ranges::begin(E), ranges::end(E)) denotes a range, and
     * both ranges::begin(E) and ranges::end(E) are amortized constant time and
       non-modifying, and
     * if the type of ranges::begin(E) models ForwardIterator, ranges::begin(E) is
       equality-preserving (in other words, forward iterators support multi-pass
       algorithms)

   Note: In the exposition-only definition above, the required expressions
   ranges::begin(std::forward<T>(t)) and ranges::end(std::forward<T>(t)) do not require
   implicit expression variations.
   3) The exposition-only concept __ForwardingRange defines the requirements of a range
   such that a function can take it by value and return iterators obtained from it
   without danger of dangling.

   Formally, given an expression E such that decltype((E)) is T and an lvalue t that
   denotes the same object as E, T models __ForwardingRange only if

     * ranges::begin(E) and ranges::begin(t) are expression-equivalent (have the same
       effect when evaluated, and both or neither are potentially-throwing, both or
       neither are constant subexpressions), and
     * ranges::end(E) and ranges::end(t) are expression-equivalent, and
     * the validity of iterators obtained from the object denoted by E is not tied to
       the lifetime of that object.
