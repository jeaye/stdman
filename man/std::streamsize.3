.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <ios>
   typedef /*unspecified*/ streamsize;

   The type std::streamsize is a signed integral type used to represent the number of
   characters transferred in an I/O operation or the size of an I/O buffer. It is used
   as a signed counterpart of std::size_t, similar to the POSIX type ssize_t.

   Except in the constructors of std::strstreambuf, negative values of std::streamsize
   are never used.
