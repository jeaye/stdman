std::weak_equality \- std::weak_equality

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <compare>
   class weak_equality;         \fI(since C++20)\fP

   The class type std::weak_equality is the result type of a three-way comparison that

     * admits only equality and inequality comparisons (no less-than/greater-than)

     * does not imply substitutability: if a is equivalent to b, f(a) may not be
       equivalent to f(b), where f denotes a function that reads only
       comparison-salient state that is accessible via the argument's public const
       members. In other words, equivalent values may be distinguishable.

   std::weak_equality is the weakest comparison category type: it is not
   implicitly-convertible to any other comparison category, but the other four
   comparison categories (std::strong_equality, std::partial_ordering,
   std::weak_ordering, std::strong_ordering) are implicitly-convertible to
   std::weak_equality.

.SH Constants

   The type std::weak_equality has only two valid values, implemented as const static
   data members of its type: std::weak_equality::equivalent and
   std::weak_equality::nonequivalent:

   Member constant                 Definition
   equivalent(inline constexpr)    a valid value of the type std::weak_equality
   \fB[static]\fP                        indicating equivalence
                                   \fI(public static member constant)\fP
   nonequivalent(inline constexpr) a valid value of the type std::weak_equality
   \fB[static]\fP                        indicating non-equivalence
                                   \fI(public static member constant)\fP

.SH Comparisons

   Comparison operators are defined between values of this type and literal 0. This
   supports the expressions a <=> b == 0 and a <=> b != 0 used to convert the result of
   a three-way comparison operator to a boolean relationship; see std::is_eq and
   std::is_neq.

   The behavior of a program that attempts to compare a weak_equality with anything
   other than the integer literal 0 is undefined.

   operator==  compares with zero
   operator!=  \fI(function)\fP
   operator<=>

operator==

   friend constexpr bool operator==(weak_equality v, /*unspecified*/ u) noexcept;
   friend constexpr bool operator==(/*unspecified*/ u, weak_equality v) noexcept;

.SH Parameters

   v - a std::weak_equality value to check
   u - an unused parameter of any type that accepts literal zero argument

.SH Return value

   true if v is equivalent, false if v is nonequivalent

operator!=

   friend constexpr bool operator!=(weak_equality v, /*unspecified*/ u) noexcept;
   friend constexpr bool operator!=(/*unspecified*/ u, weak_equality v) noexcept;

.SH Parameters

   v - a std::weak_equality value to check
   u - an unused parameter of any type that accepts literal zero argument

.SH Return value

   false if v is equivalent, and true if v is nonequivalent

operator<=>

   friend constexpr weak_equality operator<=>(weak_equality v, /*unspecified*/ u)
   noexcept;
   friend constexpr weak_equality operator<=>(/*unspecified*/ u, weak_equality v)
   noexcept;

.SH Parameters

   v - a std::weak_equality value to check
   u - an unused parameter of any type that accepts literal zero argument
