.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <format>
   enum class range_format {

       disabled,
       map,
       set,                    (since C++23)
       sequence,
       string,
       debug_string

   };

   Specifies how a range should be formatted.

   Constant     Explanation
   disabled     disallows range default formatter to format range
                allows to format range as map representation with modified brackets
   map          "{", "}" and separator ": " for underlying pair-like types in the
                following format:
                { key-1 : value-1, ..., key-n : value-n }
                allows to format range as set representation with modified brackets "{"
   set          and "}" in the following format:
                { key-1, ..., key-n }
                allows to format range as sequence representation with default brackets
   sequence     "[", "]" and separator ", " in the following format:
                [ element-1, ..., element-n ]
   string       allows to format range as string
   debug_string allows to format range as escaped string
