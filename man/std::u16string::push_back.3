.SH NAME
std::basic_string::push_back \- std::basic_string::push_back

.SH Synopsis
   void push_back( CharT ch );  (constexpr since C++20)

   Appends the given character ch to the end of the string.

.SH Parameters

   ch - the character to append

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Complexity

   Amortized constant.

.SH Exceptions

   If the operation would result in size() > max_size(), throws std::length_error.

   If an exception is thrown for any reason, this function has no effect (strong
   exception safety guarantee).

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <iomanip>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <string>

 int main()
 {
     std::string str{"Short string"};
     std::cout << "1) " << std::quoted(str) << ", size: " << str.size() << '\\n';

     str.push_back('!');
     std::cout << "2) " << std::quoted(str) << ", size: " << str.size() << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 1) "Short string", size: 12
 2) "Short string!", size: 13
