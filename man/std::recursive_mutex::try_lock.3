.TH std::recursive_mutex::try_lock 3 "Jun 28 2014" "2.0 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   bool try_lock();  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Tries to lock the mutex. Returns immediately. On successful lock acquisition returns
   true, otherwise returns false.

   This function is allowed to fail spuriously and return false even if the mutex is
   not currently locked by any other thread.

   A thread may call try_lock on a recursive mutex repeatedly. Successful calls to
   try_lock increment the ownsership count: the mutex will only be released after the
   thread makes a matching number of calls to unlock.

   The maximum number of levels of ownership is unspecified. A call to try_lock will
   return false if this number is exceeded.

   Prior unlock() operation on the same mutex synchronizes-with (as defined in
   std::memory_order) this operation if it returns true. Note that prior lock() does
   not synchronize with this operation if it returns false.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   true if the lock was acquired successfully, otherwise false.

.SH Exceptions

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Example

   
   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <mutex>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::mutex test;
     if (test.try_lock()==true) {
         std::cout << "lock acquired" << std::endl;
         test.unlock();  //now unlock the mutex
     } else {
         std::cout << "lock not acquired" << std::endl;
     }
  
     test.lock();        //to lock it again
     if (test.try_lock()) {  //true can be left out
         std::cout << "lock acquired" << std::endl;
     } else {
         std::cout << "lock not acquired" << std::endl;
     }
     test.unlock();
 }

.SH Output:

 lock acquired
 lock not acquired
