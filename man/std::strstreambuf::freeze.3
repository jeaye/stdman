.TH std::strstreambuf::freeze 3 "Nov 16 2016" "2.1 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::strstreambuf::freeze \- std::strstreambuf::freeze

.SH Synopsis
   void freeze( bool freezefl = true );

   If the buffer uses dynamic allocation, sets the frozen status of the stream to
   freezefl.

   While the stream is frozen, overflow() will not reallocate the buffer and the
   destructor will not deallocate the buffer (thereby causing a memory leak).

.SH Parameters

   freezefl - new value to set the freeze status to

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Notes

   Every call to str() freezes the stream to preserve the validity of the pointer it
   returns. To allow the destructor to deallocate the buffer, freeze(false) needs to be
   called explicitly.

.SH Example

   In this example, initial allocation of the underlying array was for 16 bytes

   
// Run this code

 #include <strstream>
 #include <iostream>

 int main()
 {
     {
         std::strstream dyn; // dynamically-allocated read/write buffer
         dyn << "Test: " << 1.23; // note: no std::ends to demonstrate append behavior
         std::cout << "dynamic buffer holds " << dyn.pcount() << " characters: '";
         std::cout.write(dyn.str(), dyn.pcount()) << "'\\n";
         // the buffer is now frozen, further output will not make the buffer grow
         dyn << "more output, hopefully enough to run out of the allocated space" << std::ends;
         std::cout << "After more output, it holds "
                   << dyn.pcount() << " characters: '" << dyn.str() << "'\\n";
         dyn.freeze(false); // unfreeze before destructor
     } // memory freed by the destructor

     {
         char arr[20];
         std::ostrstream st(arr, sizeof arr); // fixed-size buffer
         st << 1.23; // note: no std::ends to demonstrate append behavior
         std::cout << "static buffer holds "
                   << st.pcount() << " characters: '";
         std::cout.write(st.str(), st.pcount());
         std::cout << "'\\n";
         st << "more output, hopefully enough to run out of the allocated space" << std::ends;
         std::cout << "static buffer holds "
                   << st.pcount() << " characters: '";
         std::cout.write(st.str(), st.pcount());
         std::cout << "'\\n";
     } // nothing to deallocate, no need to unfreeze,
 }

.SH Output:

 dynamic buffer holds 10 characters: 'Test: 1.23'
 After more output, it holds 16 characters: 'Test: 1.23more o'
 static buffer holds 4 characters: '1.23'
 static buffer holds 20 characters: '1.23more output, hop'
