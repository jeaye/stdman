.SH NAME
std::pop_heap \- std::pop_heap

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <algorithm>
   template< class RandomIt >                                    \fB(1)\fP
   void pop_heap( RandomIt first, RandomIt last );
   template< class RandomIt, class Compare >                     \fB(2)\fP
   void pop_heap( RandomIt first, RandomIt last, Compare comp );

   Swaps the value in the position first and the value in the position last-1 and makes
   the subrange [first, last-1) into a max heap. This has the effect of removing the
   first (largest) element from the heap defined by the range [first, last).

   The first version of the function uses operator< to compare the elements, the second
   uses the given comparison function comp.

.SH Parameters

   first, last - the range of elements defining the valid nonempty heap to modify
                 comparison function object (i.e. an object that satisfies the
                 requirements of Compare) which returns true if the first argument is
                 less than the second.

                 The signature of the comparison function should be equivalent to the
                 following:
   comp        -
                  bool cmp(const Type1 &a, const Type2 &b);

                 The signature does not need to have const &, but the function object
                 must not modify the objects passed to it.
                 The types Type1 and Type2 must be such that an object of type RandomIt
                 can be dereferenced and then implicitly converted to both of them. 
.SH Type requirements
   -
   RandomIt must meet the requirements of ValueSwappable and RandomAccessIterator.
   -
   The type of dereferenced RandomIt must meet the requirements of MoveAssignable and
   MoveConstructible.

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Complexity

   At most 2×log(N) comparisons where N=std::distance(first, last).

.SH Notes

   A max heap is a range of elements [f,l) that has the following properties:

     * With N = l - f, for all 0 < i < N, f[floor(

       i-1
       2

       )] does not compare less than f[i].
     * a new element can be added using std::push_heap()
     * the first element can be removed using std::pop_heap()

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <algorithm>
 #include <vector>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::vector<int> v { 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9 };
  
     std::make_heap(v.begin(), v.end());
  
     std::cout << "v: ";
     for (auto i : v) std::cout << i << ' ';
     std::cout << '\\n';
  
     std::pop_heap(v.begin(), v.end()); // moves the largest to the end
  
     std::cout << "after pop_heap: ";
     for (auto i : v) std::cout << i << ' ';
     std::cout << '\\n';
  
     int largest = v.back();
     v.pop_back();  // actually removes the largest element
     std::cout << "largest element: " << largest << '\\n';
  
     std::cout << "heap without largest: ";
     for (auto i : v) std::cout << i << ' ';
     std::cout << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 v: 9 5 4 1 1 3
 after pop_heap: 5 3 4 1 1 9
 largest element: 9
 heap without largest: 5 3 4 1 1
