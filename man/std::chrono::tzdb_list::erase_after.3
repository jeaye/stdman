.SH NAME
std::chrono::tzdb_list::erase_after \- std::chrono::tzdb_list::erase_after

.SH Synopsis
   const_iterator erase_after( const_iterator p );  \fI(since C++20)\fP

   Erases the std::chrono::tzdb referred to by the iterator following p. The behavior
   is undefined if that iterator is not dereferenceable. No pointers, references, or
   iterators are invalidated except for those referring to the erased element.

.SH Return value

   An iterator pointing to the element following the erased element, or end() if no
   such element exists.

.SH Notes

   tzdb_list is intended to be implementable as a singly linked list, and its interface
   resembles that of std::forward_list. It has no before_begin(), however, and so it is
   not possible to erase the first element.
