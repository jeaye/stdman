.SH NAME
std::domain_error \- std::domain_error

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <stdexcept>
   class domain_error;

   Defines a type of object to be thrown as exception. It may be used by the
   implementation to report domain errors, that is, situations where the inputs are
   outside of the domain on which an operation is defined.

   The standard library components do not throw this exception (mathematical functions
   report domain errors as specified in math_errhandling). Third-party libraries,
   however, use this. For example, boost.math throws std::domain_error if
   boost::math::policies::throw_on_error is enabled (the default setting).

.SH Member functions

   constructor   constructs the exception object
                 \fI(public member function)\fP

std::domain_error::domain_error

   explicit domain_error( const std::string& what_arg ); \fB(1)\fP
   explicit domain_error( const char* what_arg );        \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Constructs the exception object with what_arg as explanatory string that can be
   accessed through what().

   Because copying std::exception is not permitted to throw exceptions, this message is
   typically stored internally as a copy-on-write string. This is also why there is no
   constructor taking std::string&&: it would have to copy the content anyway.

.SH Parameters

   what_arg - explanatory string

.SH Exceptions

   \fI(none)\fP

Inherited from std::exception

.SH Member functions

   destructor   destructs the exception object
   \fB[virtual]\fP    \fI(virtual public member function of std::exception)\fP
   what         returns an explanatory string
   \fB[virtual]\fP    \fI(virtual public member function of std::exception)\fP
