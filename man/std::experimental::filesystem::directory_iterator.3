.TH std::experimental::filesystem::directory_iterator 3 "Sep  4 2015" "2.0 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/filesystem>
   class directory_iterator;                    (filesystem TS)

   directory_iterator is an InputIterator that iterates over the directory_entry
   elements of a directory (but does not visit the subdirectories). The iteration order
   is unspecified, except that each directory entry is visited only once. The special
   pathnames dot and dot-dot are skipped.

   If the directory_iterator is advanced past the last directory entry, it becomes
   equal to the default-constructed iterator, also known as the end iterator. Two end
   iterators are always equal, dereferencing or incrementing the end iterator is
   undefined behavior.

   If a file or a directory is deleted or added to the directory tree after the
   directory iterator has been created, it is unspecified whether the change would be
   observed through the iterator.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <fstream>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <experimental/filesystem>
 namespace fs = std::experimental::filesystem;

 int main()
 {
     fs::create_directories("sandbox/a/b");
     std::ofstream("sandbox/file1.txt");
     std::ofstream("sandbox/file2.txt");
     for(auto& p: fs::directory_iterator("sandbox"))
         std::cout << p << '\\n';
     fs::remove_all("sandbox");
 }
