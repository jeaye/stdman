.SH NAME
std::basic_istream::read \- std::basic_istream::read

.SH Synopsis
   basic_istream& read( char_type* s, std::streamsize count );

   Extracts characters from stream.

   Behaves as UnformattedInputFunction. After constructing and checking the sentry
   object, extracts characters and stores them into successive locations of the
   character array whose first element is pointed to by s. Characters are extracted and
   stored until any of the following conditions occurs:

     * count characters were extracted and stored

     * end of file condition occurs on the input sequence (in which case,
       setstate(failbit|eofbit) is called). The number of successfully extracted
       characters can be queried using gcount().

.SH Parameters

   s     - pointer to the character array to store the characters to
   count - number of characters to read

.SH Return value

   *this

.SH Exceptions

   
   failure if an error occurred (the error state flag is not goodbit) and exceptions()
   is set to throw for that state.

   If an internal operation throws an exception, it is caught and badbit is set. If
   exceptions() is set for badbit, the exception is rethrown.

.SH Notes

   When using a non-converting locale (the default locale is non-converting), the
   overrider of this function in std::basic_ifstream may be optimized for zero-copy
   bulk I/O (by means of overriding std::streambuf::xsgetn)

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <fstream>
 #include <sstream>
 #include <string>
 #include <cstdint>
  
 int main()
 {
     // read() is often used for binary I/O
     std::string bin = {'\\x12', '\\x12', '\\x12', '\\x12'};
     std::istringstream raw(bin);
     std::uint32_t n;
     if(raw.read(reinterpret_cast<char*>(&n), sizeof n))
         std::cout << std::hex << std::showbase << n << '\\n';
  
     // prepare file for next snippet
     std::ofstream("test.txt", std::ios::binary) << "abcd1\\nabcd2\\nabcd3";
  
     // read entire file into string
     if(std::ifstream is{"test.txt", std::ios::binary | std::ios::ate}) {
         auto size = is.tellg();
         std::string str(size, '\\0'); // construct string to stream size
         is.seekg(0);
         if(is.read(&str[0], size))
             std::cout << str << '\\n';
     }
 }

.SH Output:

 0x12121212
 abcd1
 abcd2
 abcd3
