.SH NAME
std::terminate \- std::terminate

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <exception>
   void terminate();               \fI(until C++11)\fP
   [[noreturn]] void terminate();  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   std::terminate() is called by the C++ runtime when exception handling fails for any
   of the following reasons:

   1) an exception is thrown and not caught (it is implementation-defined whether any
   stack unwinding is done in this case)
   2) an exception is thrown during exception handling (e.g. from a destructor of some
   local object, or from a function that had to be called during exception handling)
   3) the constructor or the destructor of a static or thread-local object throws an
   exception
   4) a function registered with std::atexit or std::at_quick_exit throws an exception
   5) a noexcept specification is violated (it is implementation-defined whether any
   stack unwinding is done in this case)

   6) a dynamic exception specification is violated and the default
   handler for std::unexpected is executed
   7) a non-default handler for std::unexpected throws an exception that  \fI(until C++17)\fP
   violates the previously violated dynamic exception specification, if
   the specification does not include std::bad_exception

   8) std::nested_exception::rethrow_nested is called for an object that isn't holding
   a captured exception
   9) an exception is thrown from the initial function of std::thread
   10) a joinable std::thread is destroyed or assigned to

   11) a function invoked by a parallel algorithm exits via an uncaught   \fI(since C++17)\fP
   exception and the execution policy specifies termination.

   std::terminate() may also be called directly from the program.

   In any case, std::terminate calls the currently installed std::terminate_handler.
   The default std::terminate_handler calls std::abort.

   If a destructor reset the terminate handler during stack unwinding and
   the unwinding later led to terminate being called, the handler that
   was installed at the end of the throw expression is the one that will  \fI(until C++11)\fP
   be called. (note: it was ambiguous whether re-throwing applied the new
   handlers)
   If a destructor reset the terminate handler during stack unwinding, it
   is unspecified which handler is called if the unwinding later led to   \fI(since C++17)\fP
   terminate being called.
