.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <atomic>
   template< class T >

   T atomic_fetch_min( std::atomic<T>* obj,                           \fB(1)\fP (since C++26)

                       typename std::atomic<T>::value_type arg )
   noexcept;
   template< class T >

   T atomic_fetch_min( volatile std::atomic<T>* obj,                  \fB(2)\fP (since C++26)

                       typename std::atomic<T>::value_type arg )
   noexcept;
   template< class T >

   T atomic_fetch_min_explicit( std::atomic<T>* obj,
                                typename std::atomic<T>::value_type   \fB(3)\fP (since C++26)
   arg,

                                std::memory_order order ) noexcept;
   template< class T >

   T atomic_fetch_min_explicit( volatile std::atomic<T>* obj,
                                typename std::atomic<T>::value_type   \fB(4)\fP (since C++26)
   arg,

                                std::memory_order order ) noexcept;

   Atomically replaces the value pointed by obj with the result of std::min between the
   old value of obj and arg. Returns the value obj held previously. The operation is
   performed as if the following was executed:

   1,2) obj->fetch_min(arg)
   3,4) obj->fetch_min(arg, order)

   If std::atomic<T> has no fetch_min member (this member is only provided for integral
   and pointer types except bool), the program is ill-formed.

.SH Parameters

   obj   - pointer to the atomic object to modify
   arg   - the value to std::min with the value stored in the atomic object
   order - the memory synchronization ordering

.SH Return value

   The value immediately preceding the effects of this function in the modification
   order of *obj.

                             atomically performs std::min between the argument and the
   fetch_min                 value of the atomic object and obtains the value held
   (C++26)                   previously
                             \fI(public member function of std::atomic<T>)\fP
   atomic_fetch_max          replaces the atomic object with the result of std::max
   atomic_fetch_max_explicit with a non-atomic argument and obtains the previous value
   (C++26)                   of the atomic
   (C++26)                   \fI(function template)\fP
