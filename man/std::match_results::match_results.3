.SH Synopsis
   match_results() : match_results(Allocator()) { } \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   explicit match_results( const Allocator& a );    \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   match_results( const match_results& rhs );       \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   match_results( match_results&& rhs ) noexcept;   \fB(4)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   1) Default constructor. Constructs a match result with no established result state
   (ready() != true).
   2) Constructs a match result with no established result state (ready() != true)
   using a copy of a as the allocator.
   3) Copy constructor. Constructs a match result with a copy of rhs.
   4) Move constructor. Constructs a match result with the contents of rhs using move
   semantics. rhs is in valid, but unspecified state after the call.

.SH Parameters

   a   - allocator to use for all memory allocations of this container
   rhs - another match_result to use as source to initialize the match_result with

.SH Exceptions

   1-3) May throw implementation-defined exceptions.
