.SH NAME
std::gamma_distribution<RealType>::gamma_distribution \- std::gamma_distribution<RealType>::gamma_distribution

.SH Synopsis
   gamma_distribution() : gamma_distribution(1.0) {}                  \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   explicit gamma_distribution( RealType alpha, RealType beta = 1.0   \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   );
   explicit gamma_distribution( const param_type& params );           \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Constructs a new distribution object. \fB(2)\fP uses alpha and beta as the distribution
   parameters. \fB(3)\fP uses params as the distribution parameters.

.SH Parameters

   alpha  - the α distribution parameter (shape)
   beta   - the β distribution parameter (scale)
   params - the distribution parameter set
