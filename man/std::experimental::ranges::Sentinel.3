.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/ranges/iterator>
   template< class S, class I >

   concept bool Sentinel =                           (ranges TS)
       Semiregular<S> && Iterator<I> &&

       WeaklyEqualityComparableWith<S, I>;

   The Sentinel concept specifies the relationship between an Iterator type and a
   Semiregular type whose values denote a range.

   Let s and i be values of type S and I, respectively, such that [i, s) denotes a
   range. Sentinel<S, I> is satisfied only if:

     * i == s is well-defined.
     * If bool(i != s) then i is dereferenceable and [++i, s) denotes a range.

   The domain of == can change over time. Given an iterator i and sentinel s such that
   [i, s) denotes a range and i != s, [i, s) is not required to continue to denote a
   range after incrementing any iterator equal to i (and so i == s is no longer
   required to be well-defined after such an increment).
