   Constructs a unique_lock, optionally locking the supplied mutex.

   1) Constructs a unique_lock with no associated mutex.
   2) Move constructor. Initializes the unique_lock with the contents of other. Leaves
   other with no associated mutex.
   3-8) Constructs a unique_lock with m as the associated mutex. Additionally:
   3) Locks the associated mutex by calling m.lock(). The behavior is undefined if the
   current thread already owns the mutex except when the mutex is recursive.
   4) Does not lock the associated mutex.
   5) Tries to lock the associated mutex without blocking by calling m.try_lock(). The
   behavior is undefined if the current thread already owns the mutex except when the
   mutex is recursive.
   6) Assumes the calling thread already owns m.
   7) Tries to lock the associated mutex by calling m.try_lock_for(timeout_duration).
   Blocks until specified timeout_duration has elapsed or the lock is acquired,
   whichever comes first. May block for longer than timeout_duration.
   8) Tries to lock the associated mutex by calling m.try_lock_until(timeout_time).
   Blocks until specified timeout_time has been reached or the lock is acquired,
   whichever comes first. May block for longer than until timeout_time has been
   reached.

.SH Parameters

   other            - another unique_lock to initialize the state with
   m                - mutex to associate with the lock and optionally acquire ownership
                      of
   t                - tag parameter used to select constructors with different locking
                      strategies
   timeout_duration - maximum duration to block for
   timeout_time     - maximum time point to block until

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <thread>
 #include <vector>
 #include <mutex>
 std::mutex m_a, m_b, m_c;
 int a, b, c = 1;
 void update()
 {
     {   // Note: std::lock_guard or atomic<int> can be used instead
         std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lk(m_a);
         a++;
     }

     { // Note: see std::lock and std::scoped_lock for details and alternatives
       std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lk_b(m_b, std::defer_lock);
       std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lk_c(m_c, std::defer_lock);
       std::lock(lk_b, lk_c);
       b = std::exchange(c, b+c);
    }
 }

 int main()
 {
   std::vector<std::thread> threads;
   for (unsigned i = 0; i < 12; ++i)
     threads.emplace_back(update);

   for (auto& i: threads)
     i.join();

   std::cout << a << "'th and " << a+1 << "'th Fibonacci numbers: "
             << b << " and " << c << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 12'th and 13'th Fibonacci numbers: 144 and 233
