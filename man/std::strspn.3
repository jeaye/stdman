.SH NAME
std::strspn \- std::strspn

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstring>
   size_t strspn( const char* dest, const char* src );

   Returns the length of the maximum initial segment (span) of the byte string pointed
   to by dest, that consists of only the characters found in byte string pointed to by
   src.

.SH Parameters

   dest - pointer to the null-terminated byte string to be analyzed
   src  - pointer to the null-terminated byte string that contains the characters to
          search for

.SH Return value

   The length of the maximum initial segment that contains only characters from byte
   string pointed to by src

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <cstring>
 #include <string>
 #include <iostream>
  
 const char *low_alpha = "qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm";
 int main()
 {
     std::string s = "abcde312$#@";
  
     std::size_t spnsz = std::strspn(s.c_str(), low_alpha);
     std::cout << "After skipping initial lowercase letters from '" << s
               << "'\\nThe remainder is '" << s.substr(spnsz) << "'\\n";
 }

.SH Output:

 After skipping initial lowercase letters from 'abcde312$#@'
 The remainder is '312$#@'
